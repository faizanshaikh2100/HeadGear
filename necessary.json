    "description": "Chi-Fi Excellence\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n1 Year of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nMetal Build\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nElectrostatic Drivers\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDescription\n\nEXPERIENCE A MYRIAD OF EMOTIONS AND A RANGE OF FREQUENCIES WITH SUPERIOR SONIC STABILITY\n\nThe HiFiMAN - Shangri-La Jr gives you a sound that is smooth and organic. Not only the vocals, even the instruments convey every emotion as you hear them in their finest detail. The super-wide soundstage lets you feel your music come alive. Enjoy music that flows through a range of frequencies from 7Hz to 120KHz. Like the diaphragm, even the metal mesh stators have a super-fine grating that let sound waves lower than 1 million hertz pass through without any distortion. The stators are crafted using a specialised metallic alloy. This gives you sonic stability with acoustically transparent audio.\n\nHIGHLY OPTIMIZED THIN DIAPHRAGM FOR CLEAR SOUND\n\nFor the best sound experience, the HiFiMAN - Shangri-La Jr comes with a diaphragm that is so fine (0.001mm), it is thinner than a strand of human hair. It has a nanoparticle coating which enables it to move extremely fast and gives you an unsurpassed high-frequency response.\n\n6SN7N VACUUM TUBES FOR A WARM SOUND\n\nIt’s not just the HiFiMAN - Shangri-La Jr that creates the magic you listen to but also the amp that comes with it. This amplifier has the finest hand-matched 6SN7N vacuum tubes. These tubes function closely to the output and give you a warm luxurious sound quality, one at par only with the best.\n\n24-STEP ATTENUATOR FOR PRECISION\n\nSay goodbye to noise, even during the slightest change in volume. The 24-step attenuator ensures that there is no added distortion in the system.\n\nDESIGNED KEEPING YOUR UTMOST COMFORT IN MIND\n\nThe HiFiMAN - Shangri-La Jr has been designed keeping in mind long music-listening sessions. The headphone is lightweight while the soft headband is adjustable and ensures supreme comfort. The open-backed design gives you a view of the driver hard at work. The sleek look of the amp enhances any tabletop. Visitors are certainly going to come over for a second look.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nNanotech Driver\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n7Hz - 12kHz\n\nBIAS VOLTAGE\n550V-650V\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-Ear (Circumaural)\n\nHEADPHONE STYLE\nOpen-Back\n\nWEIGHT\n13.2oz (374g)\n\nDIMENSIONS\n400 x 265 x 108 mm3 (15.7\" x 10.4\" x 4.2\")\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

To claim warranty read more here.\n\nWhat is the difference between the HiFiMAN - Shangri-La and HiFiMAN - Shangri-La Jr?\n\nIn a nutshell: The HiFiMAN Shangri-La has a 300B vacuum tube amp while the HiFiMAN Shangri-La Jr has a 6SN7N vacuum tube amp. An important decision. Choose wisely.\n\nElectrostatic...hmmm...is there any danger of getting a shock?\n\nNo, these headphones are absolutely safe and you do not need to worry about getting a shock. There are many resistors to keep the current low. There is also a relay-based system that cuts off the output if there is any problem in the amp.\n\nIs there any risk of arcing?\n\nArcing is a situation when the voltage passing through the headphone increases suddenly and is transferred from one electrode to the diaphragm/ other electrode. This can cause heavy damage to the driver unit. Fortunately, the Shangri-La jr comes with a nanometer-thick dust cover that prevents arcing.\n\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this HiFiMAN Shangri-La Jr comes with a 1 year warranty from HiFiMAN that covers manufacturing defects. All products featured on Headphone Zone are backed by an original manufacturer's warranty. Read more about HiFiMAN's warranty in India.\n\nBEST OPEN HEADPHONES 2021\nHEADFONICS Dec, 2021",

    "description": "Designed in the UK\n\n3 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nFPGA DAC Chip\n\nMetal Build\n\nPair with Laptop via USB\n\nConnect With USB, BNC & Optical\n\nThe Chord Qutest is pretty much my favourite DAC. Period. For about a lakh, I don't think I like any other DAC quite the same way. Sure, some might be technically better, some might have better test results. But music doesn't sound the same on anything else.\n\nRAGHAV SOMANI\nHeadphone Guru\n\nAbout Raghav Somani\nRaghav Somani is the Founder & CEO of Headphone Zone. An avid audiophile and musician since 2008, his choice of headphones include STAX Electrostats, Audeze LCD 3, and for music on the go, the JH Audio Roxanne + Astell&Kern SP1000 is never too far away. On his playlist, you'll find A.R. Rahman, Michael Jackson, and the Eagles.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nUPGRADE YOUR HOME SET-UP'S SOUND\n\nUnlike other DACs by Chord Electronics, the Qutest does not have headphone amplification or rechargeable batteries. It is a pure DAC made to improve your home listening set-up. With its FPGA DAC, you get superior technical and sonic performance. With 49,152 taps, this DAC is able to support even Native DSD 512 (Octa-DSD).\n\nMULTIPLE CONNECTIVITY OPTIONS\n\nConnect to a wide variety of devices with the Qutest’s optical, 2 BNC Coax and USB Type-B digital inputs. These are galvanically isolated to give an instant performance upgrade as well as to modernise ageing digital source components. Connect to future Chord Electronics devices with Hi-Res dual-data digital inputs. RCA analogue outputs let you connect to headphone amps, preamps and integrated amps.\n\nSUPPORTS ALL YOUR CHOICES\n\nThe Qutest lets you select from its four frequency-shaping filters and input selection controls. This can be done via the two fascia-mounted spheres. You can also choose whether you want the output voltage to be 1, 2 or 3 RMS for connecting to a range of devices. It supports a wide range of frequencies like 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88.2kHz, 96kHz, 176.4kHz, 192kHz, 358.8kHz, 384kHz, 717.6kHz and 768kHz.\n\nHIGH-QUALITY, DURABLE ALUMINIUM CASING\n\nThe Qutest sports a show-off-worthy chassis. This all-new chassis has been precision-machined from solid aircraft-grade aluminium for better durability. The PCB has been kept in a shallow cavity in the casing for additional isolation and protection from external vibration.\n\nSPECS\n\nGENERAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDEVICE POWER SUPPLY\n5v 2amp Micro USB\n\nDIMENSIONS\n4.5cm (H) x 16cm (W) x 8.8cm (D)\n\nWEIGHT\n770g\n\nCONNECTIVITY\n\nINPUT\nUSB Type B (White): 44.1kHz to 768kHz – 16bit to 32bit\n\n2x BNC Coax (Red): 44.1kHz – 384kHz – 16bit to 32bit\n\n1x Dual data mode input (using both BNC coax inputs together): 44.1kHz to 768kHz – 16bit to 32bit\n\nOptical (Green): 44.1kHz to 96kHz – 16bit to 24bit\n\nOUTPUT\n1x stereo pair of RCA (Left and Right)\n\nVARIABLE OUTPUT\nFixed, but selectable between 3v (blue), 2v (green), and 1v (red) via dual press of ‘Filter’ + ‘Input’ upon startup\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nCHIPSET\ncustom coded Xilinx Artix 7 (XC7A15T) FPGA\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n20Hz – 20kHz +/- 0.2dB\n\nTHD\n<0.0001% 1kHz 3v RMS 300Ω\n\nTHD & NOISE\n117dB at 1kHz 300ohms @3v RMS\n\nCHANNEL SEPARATION\n138dB at 1kHz 300Ω\n\nTAP LENGTH\n49,152\n\nPULSE ARRAY\n10 element pulse array design\n\nPCM SUPPORT\n44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88.2kHz, 96kHz, 176.4kHz, 192kHz, 358.8kHz, 384kHz, 717.6kHz, and 768kHz.\n\nDSD SUPPORT\nNative playback supported.

Safety instructions\n\nFAQS\n\nWhat is a DAC?\n\nA DAC is a processor that converts digital audio information (consisting of a series of 0s and 1s) into an analogue audio signal. This gives you a better sound quality.\n\nDoes the Qutest serve as an amp too?\n\nNo, it doesn’t. The Qutest is a standalone DAC that is dedicated only to give you a great sound.\n\nIs it compatible with Mac and Windows?\n\nThe Quetest has driverless support for Mac OS X and Linux. You will be required to install a supported driver to use it with your PC.\n\nUser Guide\n\nLearn how to make the most out of your Chord Qutest with information on how to protect and clean your device from time to time. Get information on battery life indicators and configuring these with other devices.\n\nRead More\n\nWarranty & Media Reviews\n\n3 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Chord Qutest comes with a 3 year warranty from Chord that covers manufacturing defects.

In order to claim warranty, please visit our Audio-Technica warranty page. We are very helpful guys, just saying.\n\nThe sound signature of the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x is?\n\nVery flat. Essentially made for professional studio monitoring, you can expect a neutral sound from the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x. Bassheads, leave now before you set yourself up for disappointment.\n\nIs the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x ideal for DJs?\n\nNo, they are not. You can have a look at the V-MODA Crossfade LP2 as it is ideal for DJ and live shows.\n\nDoes the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x come with an open-back design?\n\nNo, it doesn’t. If you are looking for a wide soundstage our top recommendation will be the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro. It features an open-back design with much more detailing as compared to the ATH-M50x.\n\nWill Audio-Technica ATH-M50x require an Amp?\n\nAlthough your smartphone and laptop will be able to drive it, an amplifier would certainly bring out the true potential of the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x. Read more about amplification and why it's important here.\n\nWhat is the difference between the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x and the Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro?\n\nThe Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro will have a flatter response, as accurate to the source as possible. The Audio-Technica ATH-M50x will have relatively extended low end in comparison.\n\nDoes detachable cable mean I can use it without the wire as well?\n\nNo, they can’t. Detachable cables mean they can be replaced when they go south!\n\nAre Audio-Technica ATH-M50x built to last? Could I use it when travelling?\n\nYes, they are durable and are travel friendly since they fold and a travel carry pouch is also included with the product.\n\nCould I change the parts if they wear out?\n\nYes, we provide high quality replacement parts for the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x. You can replace the headband and the earpads from Headphone Zone directly.\n\nHow many cables does the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x come with?\n\nThe product comes with 3 cables: 3.9 to 9.8' (1.2 to 3 m) Coiled Cable, 9.8' (3 m) Straight Cable and 3.9' (1.2 m) Straight Cable. Who doesn't like options?\n\nWhat devices is the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x compatible with?\n\nThese headphones are mostly used by studio professionals and come with a 6.3mm adaptor for use with consoles. You can also use the 3.5mm jack with your laptop or smartphone.\n\nIs Audio-Technica ATH-M50x an ideal product for everyday casual use?\n\nIdeally no. Because these require a dedicated amp for the best quality and because they're quite flat sounding, we wouldn't recommend these to casual music listeners.\n\nHow do Audio-Technica ATH-M50x stack up against Ultrasone Performance 820?\n\nBoth these headphones are flagship products under the 10k range having their strenghts and usability. To help understand better we have an easy to understand blog comparing the Audio Technica M50x vs Ultrasone Performance 820 here.\n\nBUYING GUIDE\n\nBest Headphones under 10000 in 2020\nby Abhijeeth Shetty February 27, 2020\nScan through the list with our go-to guide of headphones under Rs. 10000 to find the best one for you.\nRead More\n\nBeyerdynamic DT 770 Pro vs Audio-Technica ATH-M50x\nby Abhijeeth Shetty March 04, 2020\nComparing the Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro and Audio Technica ATH M50X.

    "description": "DESCRIPTION\n\nHIGH-QUALITY MATERIALS FOR OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE\n\nThe Mercury 3.0 has been crafted by expert engineers who have used only high-quality materials. It uses heavy OFHC continuous copper silver matrix conductors that have end-to-end shielding for the cable. The Final USB connectors have been machined from aircraft-grade aluminium and used gold-plated connections for extra durability.\n\nNOT YOUR AVERAGE USB CABLE\n\nUnlike common USB cables that come with barely any shielding, the Mercury 3.0 has a quadruple shielding that entirely separates and protects the USB signal from any power interference. This reduces EMI and RFI cable noise and gives you the cleanest audio you can possibly get.\n\nSHHH... ONLY PURE SOUND\n\nThe Mercury 3.0 has 3 custom-made metal oxide ceramic RF noise silencers. Since each filter has a different effective range, the RF noise is silenced over a wider range. While 2 silencers are fixed at opposite ends of the range, the middle one is adjustable and can be moved along the entire length of the cable. This detunes the antennae formed by the cable and further reduces noise.\n\nFASTER, SMOOTHER, HIGHER STANDARDS\n\nEnjoy a faster and smoother audio experience with the Mercury 3.0. This USB cable is crafted with high-quality cables and connectors. This ensures a higher standard transmission platform and a less jittery audio & power transfer. (PS: The Mercury 3.0 can support a bandwidth speed of 5.0Gbps which makes it future-proof).\n\nSpecs\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nCONSTRUCTION\nMinimu inductance parallel construction\n\nCONDUCTOR\n24 and 28AWG\n\nCONDUCTOR MATERIAL\nHeavy OFHC continuous cast copper silver matrix\n\nINSULATION\nHD Polyethylene\n\nSHIELDING\nQuadruple-shields\n\nIMPEDANCE\n90 Ohms (1% tolerance)\n\nAC SPARK INSULATION\n1500V\n\nCONNECTORS\niFi ‘FINAL’ USB connectors\n\nINSULATION RESSISTANCE\n100Mohm\n\nTENSILE STRENGTH\n1500PSI\n\nLENGTH/WEIGHT\n0.5m/98g (0.22 lbs) 1.0m/115g (0.25 lbs)\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1. iFi Audio - Mercury 3.0\n\n2.

    "description": "DESCRIPTION\n\nFIRST LARGE-SIZED TOROIDAL TRANSFORMER, CLEAR HIGH-QUALITY SOUND\n\nThe SRM-T8000 is the first driver unit by STAX that has a large-sized Toroidal Transformer. This reduces the leakage flux and helps in keeping noise low. It also leads to high-speed reproduction of sound across a wide frequency range. The SRM-T8000 uses a 6922 dual triode tube. These high-quality tubes are mounted on an independent board to eliminate vibration and noise.\n\nSTAY CONNECTED, HIGH-GRADE MATERIALS & LIGHTWEIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL\n\nNow you can easily connect your earspeakers with this driver with 4 pairs of input (the fourth one is optional). These can bypass the volume controller letting you use the SRM-T8000 as an exclusive power amplifier. What does combining an aluminium insulator, vibration-proof material and high frictional coefficient lead to? Well, a really high amount of friction power. This, and other high-quality electronic parts, together give you great tone quality and performance. Unlike most driver units that have an iron chassis, the SRM-T8000 has a non-magnetic aluminium chassis. This has made the unit lighter while eliminating a cloudy tone quality. The aluminium also adds to its sleek look.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n1～115kHz per channel\n\nTOTAL HARMONIC DISTORTION\n<0.01% @1kHz per channel\n\nGAIN\n60dB\n\nINPUT IMPEDANCE\nUnbalanced 50kΩ/ Balanced: 50kΩx2\n\nMAX.

Stax SRM-T8000 Driver Unit\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat sort of device is the SRM-T8000? Why do I need it?\n\nThe SRM-T8000 is a driver unit. A driver unit is like an amplifier. It converts electrical signals from your audio player into music when it reaches your headphones. It is mainly used for headphones and earphones that have a high impedance. Find out more here.\n\nWhat are electrostatic earspeakers?\n\nElectrostatic earspeakers are headphones that run on special electrodes that conduct electricity. Since these produce a sound that is only comparable to other loudspeakers (& not other headphones), they are known as earspeakers. Sounds cool right?\n\nWhat is the warranty like and whom should I contact?\n\nSTAX offers a manufacturer’s warranty of 1 year. In case you need to claim warranty or want to read more about it, here’s the place you need to be.\n\nWARRANTY AND MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this STAX SRM-T8000 comes with a 1 year warranty from STAX that covers manufacturing defects. All products featured on Headphone Zone are backed by an original manufacturer's warranty. Read more about STAX's warranty in India.\n\n\"The SRM-T8000 is the best energiser Stax has ever made, and if resolution and imaging are your audio ‘triggers’, then this is also the best energiser you can get for a Stax.\"\nRead More\n\n\"I can say that the combination of the SRM-T8000 amplifier and SR-009S headphones is enough to put any headphone/personal fi lover into regions of bliss.\"\nRead More",

It is a combination of an over-ear with a special tube amplifier that offers a sound worthy of it. This custom-made amp features the finest 300B tubes for an audio quality like none other.\n\n24-SETUP LEVEL OF VOLUME CONTROL\n\nSay goodbye to noise, even during the slightest change in volume. The 24-step level of volume control uses 23 separate resistors. This makes each volume level independent of the others.\n\nHIGHLY OPTIMIZED THIN DIAPHRAGM FOR CLEAR SOUND\n\nFor the best sound experience, the Shangri-La comes with a diaphragm that is so fine (0.001mm), it is thinner than a strand of human hair. It has a nanoparticle coating which enables it to move extremely fast and gives you an unsurpassed high-frequency response.\n\nDISTORTION FREE SUPERIOR SONIC EXPERIENCE\n\nEnjoy music that flows through a range of frequencies from 7Hz to 120KHz. Like the diaphragm, even the metal mesh stators have a super-fine grating that let sound waves lower than 1 million hertz pass through without any distortion. The stators are crafted using a specialised metallic alloy. This gives you sonic stability with acoustically transparent audio.\n\nEXPERIENCE 300B FOR REAL\n\nMost headphones/amps come with transformers and capacitors to increase the voltage and drive the diaphragm. The Shangri-La has neither. Thus, nothing comes between the headphone and amp and you can directly listen to the four 300B vacuum tubes.\n\nFLAGSHIP LEVEL COMFORT WITH SOFT HEADBAND, SPACIOUS EARPADS\n\nThe Shangri-La has been designed keeping in mind long music-listening sessions. The headphone is lightweight while the soft head pad is adjustable and ensures supreme comfort. The open-backed design gives you a view of the driver hard at work.

To claim warranty read more here.\n\nWhat sort of headphone is this?\n\nThe Shangri-La is an electrostatic headphone. It uses a diaphragm that is statically charged and is repelled/attracted to the stators nearby. You can read more about it here.\n\nElectrostatic...hmmm...is there any danger of getting a shock?\n\nNo, these headphones are absolutely safe and you do not need to worry about getting a shock. There are many resistors to keep the current low. There is also a relay-based system that cuts off the output if there is any problem in the amp.\n\nWhat is the difference between the Shangri-La and Shangri-La jr?\n\nIn a nutshell: The Shangri-La has a 300B vacuum tube amp while the Shangri-La jr has a 6SN7N vacuum tube amp. An important decision. Choose wisely.\n\nIs there any risk of arcing?\n\nArcing is a situation when the voltage passing through the headphone increases suddenly and is transferred from one electrode to the diaphragm/ other electrode. This can cause heavy damage to the driver unit. Fortunately, the Shangri-La comes with a nanometer-thick dust cover that prevents arcing.\n\nBuying Guide\n\nThe World's Most Expensive Headphones You Won't Believe Exist\nby Abhijeeth Shetty May 09, 2020\nThe sole purpose of these expensive headphones is to deliver the ultimate music listening experience which you won't find in low-end headphones.\nRead More\n\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this HiFiMAN Shangri-La comes with a 1 year warranty from HiFiMAN that covers manufacturing defects.

    "description": "DESCRIPTION\n\nFIRST LARGE-SIZED TOROIDAL TRANSFORMER, CLEAR HIGH-QUALITY SOUND\n\nThe SRM-T8000 is the first driver unit by STAX that has a large-sized Toroidal Transformer. This reduces the leakage flux and helps in keeping noise low. It also leads to high-speed reproduction of sound across a wide frequency range. The SRM-T8000 uses a 6922 dual triode tube. These high-quality tubes are mounted on an independent board to eliminate vibration and noise.\n\nSTAY CONNECTED, HIGH-GRADE MATERIALS & LIGHTWEIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL\n\nNow you can easily connect your earspeakers with this driver with 4 pairs of input (the fourth one is optional). These can bypass the volume controller letting you use the SRM-T8000 as an exclusive power amplifier. What does combining an aluminium insulator, vibration-proof material and high frictional coefficient lead to? Well, a really high amount of friction power. This, and other high-quality electronic parts, together give you great tone quality and performance. Unlike most driver units that have an iron chassis, the SRM-T8000 has a non-magnetic aluminium chassis. This has made the unit lighter while eliminating a cloudy tone quality. The aluminium also adds to its sleek look.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n1～115kHz per channel\n\nTOTAL HARMONIC DISTORTION\n<0.01% @1kHz per channel\n\nGAIN\n60dB\n\nINPUT IMPEDANCE\nUnbalanced 50kΩ/ Balanced: 50kΩx2\n\nMAX.

Stax SRM-T8000 Driver Unit\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat sort of device is the SRM-T8000? Why do I need it?\n\nThe SRM-T8000 is a driver unit. A driver unit is like an amplifier. It converts electrical signals from your audio player into music when it reaches your headphones. It is mainly used for headphones and earphones that have a high impedance. Find out more here.\n\nWhat are electrostatic earspeakers?\n\nElectrostatic earspeakers are headphones that run on special electrodes that conduct electricity. Since these produce a sound that is only comparable to other loudspeakers (& not other headphones), they are known as earspeakers. Sounds cool right?\n\nWhat is the warranty like and whom should I contact?\n\nSTAX offers a manufacturer’s warranty of 1 year. In case you need to claim warranty or want to read more about it, here’s the place you need to be.\n\nWARRANTY AND MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this STAX SRM-T8000 comes with a 1 year warranty from STAX that covers manufacturing defects.

However, unlike other STAX Earspeakers, it features a different design for its deep powerful sound and is hence, an Earspeaker like no other. The unique electrode structure has a gold-plated outer edge. Unlike other Earspeakers, these electrodes do not have any holes, causing the diaphragm to vibrate more. This not only gives you a rich powerful sound but also lets you experience the delicate details in your music.\n\nRIGID METAL HOUSING, EXTREME COMFORT & HIGH-QUALITY AUDIO\n\nTo thoroughly eliminate distortion, STAX encases the sound element in a thick insulated resin case. This case is firmly attached to the SR-007MK2’s body. This makes sure that only the diaphragm vibrates, giving you a sound that’s almost magical. The SR-007MK2 is made for long listening sessions. The soft lambskin earpads are adjustable so that they fit your head perfectly. For a great sound, the SR-007MK2 uses a Pure Crystal Ohno Continuous Casting (PC-OCC) cable. This 2.5m (8.2 feet) cable has a low capacity and wide format which ensures that you only get high-quality audio when you plug it in.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n6 - 41,000Hz\n\nIMPEDANCE\n170k Ω (10kHz)\n\nSENSITIVITY\n100dB / 100V r.m.s. 1 kHz\n\nBIAS VOLTAGE\n580V DC\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nTYPE\nPush-Pull electrostatic circular sound element, Open-Air type enclosure\n\nCAPACITANCE\n94pF (including cable)\n\nLEFT & RIGHT CHANNEL IDENTIFICATION\n'L' and 'R' indicated on the cable entrance point, solid line (left) and dotted line (right) on the cable\n\nCABLE\nLow capacity wide format, PC-OCC (Pure Crystal Ohno Continuous Casting) 2.5m/8.2ft\n\nAMBIENT TEMPREATURE AND HUMIDITY\n0 to 35ºC / 90% max. without condensation\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nEAR PADS\nGenuine Lamb Leather (direct skin contact), high-quality synthetic leather (surrounding portion)\n\nWEIGHT\n12.9oz without cable / 1.1lb with cable\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1. STAX SR-007MK2\n\n2. Hard Travel Case\n\nFAQs\n\nIs this an open or closed-backed headphone? Can I carry it along with me?\n\nThe SR-007MK2 is an open-backed headphone so it is certainly not the best option for a long commute. But if you’d prefer a headphone for listening at home, this should certainly be your pick. Still confused? Maybe this article could help you out.\n\nWhat is the cable like?\n\nThe SR-007MK2 has a 2.5m wide Pure Crystal Ohno Continuous Casting (PC-OCC). It’s quality at its best!\n\nWhat is the warranty like and whom should I contact?\n\nSTAX offers a manufacturer’s warranty of 1 year. In case you need to claim warranty or read more about it, here’s the place you need to be.\n\nCan I use the SR-007MK2 with my phone?\n\nNope, you can’t. The STAX SR-007MK2 has an impedance of 145K Ohms. Headphones with higher impedance need more power to run and your smartphone won’t be able to generate that. You will need an amp for this. To understand more about impedance and its effect on your beloved headphone, check out this article.\n\nWARRANTY AND MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this STAX SR-007MK2 comes with a 1 year warranty from STAX that covers manufacturing defects.

But the latest version of the Sundara is perhaps the best. You need a serious amplifier to drive this planar magnetic headphone but paired properly, these are a fantastic headphone for any audiophile.\n\nRAGHAV SOMANI\nHeadphone Guru\n\nAbout Raghav Somani\nRaghav Somani is the Founder & CEO of Headphone Zone.

On his playlist, you'll find A.R. Rahman, Michael Jackson, and the Eagles.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nSUSHEEL. SATEEK. SUNDARA.\n\nSundara has planar magnetic drivers that give you great sound. The diaphragm of this unit is 80% slimmer than the HE400 series. This gives you audio that traverses across a frequency range of 6Hz and 75KHz.

Sundara’s lovely fashion-forward looks in no way compromise on build quality.

The aluminium headband is lightweight but durable. The adjustable headband and earpads are made of synthetic leather and offer comfort of the highest order.\n\nLOOKS AS GOOD AS IT SOUNDS\n\nJust like its sound, HiFiMAN’s Sundara looks gorgeous too.

On devices with low output impedance, headphones are the louder, the lower their impedance is. In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Ω, 32 Ω, and 80 Ω are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Ω are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Ω.\n\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this HiFiMAN Sundara comes with a 1 year warranty from HiFiMAN that covers manufacturing defects.

The Loki is the best tone control device that lets you get the most out of your headphones or speakers. You don't even need to be satisfied with just reducing imperfections, get your music to sound the way you want. Whether you are a bass head, revel in the mids or simply enjoy new highs; The Loki tunes your music to your tastes.\n\nTHE MODERN EQUALISER\n\nRemember that time when equalizers used to be a stack of noisy op-amps and dust collecting sliders? Well, the Loki has certainly made life easier with its flexibility and transparency. Did you just ask how? Well, firstly, it has a gyrator for the bass. Sounds cool? Let’s move on. It also has a current feedback gain stage and passive LC filters for 3 bands. Lastly, it uses Alps potentiometers for better control.\n\nSPECS\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n20Hz-20Khz, -0.1db 2Hz-850KHz, -3dB\n\nMAXIMUM OUPUT\n10V RMS into 10K ohms\n\nTHD\nLess than 0.002%, 20Hz-20KHz, at 2V RMS in/out, pots centered, active stage enabled, less than 0.01% at any potentiometer setting\n\nIMD\nLess than 0.002%, CCIF\n\nSNR\nGreater than 109db, unweighted, referenced to 1V RMS\n\nCROSSTALK\n-80dB, 20Hz-20KHz\n\nOUTPUT IMPEDANCE\n75 ohms\n\nINPUT IMPEDANCE\n47K ohms\n\nBANDS\n20Hz, 400Hz, 2kHz, 8kHz\n\nADJUSTMENT\n+/-12dB at 20Hz and 8kHz, +/-6dB at 400Hz and 2kHz\n\nTOPOLOGY\nfully discrete, all-bipolar, symmetrical current-feedback design with no capacitors in the signal path and DC servo\n\nFILTERING\nCapacitor-gyrator for 20Hz, capacitor-inductor (LC) for all other bands\n\nPOWER CONSUMPTION\n4W\n\nWEIGHT\n453g (1 lb)\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1. Schiit Loki\n\n2. Wall-Wart\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the difference between the Schiit Loki and other equalizers?\n\nThe Schiit Loki is a lot more sleeker, transparent and flexible than other equalizers. Of course, if you still prefer the old noisy ones with dusty sliders; we are not judging.\n\nWhat kind of an equalizer is this?\n\nThe Schiit Loki is a single-gain-stage active equalizer. It also has non-constant-Q passive filtering. Translation: Each band in this equalizer changes from broad to narrow as the gain is increased.\n\nWill it give me a more true-to-life sound?\n\nThe Loki can fine-tune your audio to make it better. Whether it can sound like a recording artist in a studio? Hmmm.....It depends on what you are listening to and how much bass/treble you need.\n\nCan I bypass it entirely if I get it?\n\nAfter connecting it, you can bypass the equalizer simply by switching the switch in front. We did say it ranks high on transparency.\n\nIs it portable?\n\nConsidering you need to connect it to a power outlet, we wouldn’t really recommend it as an on-the-go device.\n\nNow hold on just a sec—are you saying we should use equalizers now?\n\nNope, you’re saying that. Not us.\n\nBut you just brought out this product!\n\nRight. And, as you’ll note, it’s a standalone product. You can add it to your system if you’d like, or act like it doesn’t exist. It won’t add itself to your cart if you happen to buy, say, a Modi Multibit (or anything else.)\n\nBuuuutttt…we thought you were crazy minimalist audiophile types who’d put their nose up in the air at the very thought of EQ?\n\nAs with the previous question, there’s nothing stopping you from assembling a minimalist, no-tone-control system from our extensive product line. Adding Loki is a choice you can make. If you’d like. No pressure.\n\nSo why bring this out now? What changed?\n\nThe world changed, and we decided to experiment a bit. That’s it in a nutshell. The longer explanation includes the fact that tone controls have pretty much become verboten over the last three decades in high-end audio. For those of you who remember some crappy tone control and EQ implementations, including dull, veiled, nasty-sounding knobs on the front of receivers and noisy, truly awful-sounding banks of 10 to 30 sliders (usually fixed in a death-grin), you know that there’s a good reason tone controls went away. But we decided to take a look at it and see what we could make with a single gain stage (rather than 10-30 op-amps in a row) and using passive LC (inductor-capacitor) filtering wherever possible. And we found that we could create an extremely transparent equalizer that allowed for some very nice control over tonal characteristics, without the downside of traditional tone controls or EQs. So we decided to make it and see if you find it interesting as well.\n\nBut…why EQ?\n\nBecause we live in an imperfect world, and because individuals have individual preferences. Nobody can say their speakers or headphones are ruler-flat. Nobody can say that all of their recordings are audiophile-quality. Loki provides a way to adjust for imperfect systems and imperfect recordings.\n\nBut…buuuuttt…is this true to the original recording? Is it what the artist intended?\n\nIf it sounds good to you, who cares?\n\nAieeeee! You’re making my head hurt! I don’t like options!\n\nCool. Then don’t get a Loki. Nobody’s making you buy it.\n\nWell, if I do get it, can I bypass it?\n\nYes. There’s a switch on the front to completely bypass the tone control stage—as in, a relay connects the input and output directly, no active devices in the signal path at all.\n\nWow, so I guess you guys really think this is transparent, if it’s that easy to A-B the input and output.\n\nYes, we do think Loki is very transparent.\n\nLet’s talk tech. What kind of EQ is this? Parametric?\n\nNo. Technically, Loki is a single-gain-stage active EQ with non-constant-Q passive filtering. In more English-y terms, that means that each band varies from broad to narrower as its gain is increased—small turns of the knobs result in broad, shallow changes, and bigger turns result in more narrow-band changes.\n\nThis gain stage, is it like Jotunheim’s Pivot Point topology?\n\nIt’s similar, yes, in that it is a fully discrete, current-feedback topology, but it is single-ended.\n\nWhoa. Wait a sec, are you saying you’re giving us a discrete, single-gain-stage, passive LC-filtered EQ, the most purist approach to tone controls…for $149? Are you nuts?\n\nWe do like high value, but we’re not crazy. At least not as an official diagnosis.\n\nWhat if I want a constant-Q EQ, or a parametric EQ?\n\nThat’s cool. There are some of those out there.

Schiit Magni Heresy\n\n2. Wall-Wart 15VAC, 1.5A\n\nFAQs\n\nWait a sec, there are two Magnis now? Why U make me choose?!?\n\nBecause some people really like our historic approach to Magni, and some people want even better measurements. So we decided to give you both: a Magni 3+ that is the ultimate expression of our discrete, current-feedback topology (basically a small speaker amp) and a Magni Heresy that is 100% integrated—all op-amps, all the time..\n\nWhy would I choose one over the other?\n\nBecause you like silver and gray, which is the finish of Magni 3+, or black and red, which are Magni Heresy's colors.\n\nNo, seriously!\n\nI think we covered this in the product description, but here goes again, with more detail ● Magni 3+: choose this one if you want an all-discrete headphone amp. Discrete means its made up of lots of individual transistors (well, actually a lot of paired matched transistors now). It’s essentially a mini speaker amp. In fact, the topology is exactly that of a 2-stage speaker amp now, since we added a driver stage and Vbe multiplier for biasing. The driver reduces distortion and the Vbe multiplier means the bias is more stable. It's a super-advanced amp, and we’re very proud of it. ● Magni Heresy: choose this one if you want a 100% op-amp-based headphone amp that delivers spectacular measurements. Thank the high-quality op-amps used: OPA1662 for gain, OPA1688 for output—eight (8) OPA1688 stages per channel, for low output impedance and very high current capability. With these advanced parts (the OPA1688 even uses feedforward in its topology), we’re getting 6-8dB lower THD+N than Magni 3+, which is already 10-15dB lower THD+N than Magni 3.\n\nWhich one sounds better?\n\nAh hell no, we aren’t falling for that. You tell us.\n\nAt least give us a hint!\n\nWe think both amps sound very, very good, or else we wouldn’t offer both of them. We developed the Magni Heresy largely to see what could be accomplished with a simple topology and modern op-amps, but we’re very pleased with the way it came out. At the same time, we think Magni 3+ provides compelling reasons that you shouldn’t choose everything simply based on numbers. But seriously, you tell us.\n\nWhy the name “Heresy?”\n\nWhen we started developing an all-op-amp Magni, it was 100% counter to everything we’ve done. We’ve always done fully discrete designs, when we weren’t so cost-constrained that they weren’t practical. Going op-amp was far, far easier, and more typical in today’s world, but it was, well, almost anathema. So to us, an op-amp Magni was heresy. But we’re happy with the way it turned out!\n\nIf Heresy is so good, why’d you bother with Magni 3+?\n\nThat’s a great question, isn’t it? Why would we bother with a much more complex, harder to produce product that takes a lot more engineering time and skill (the Magni 3+)? Well, we believe that the numbers don’t tell the entire story. We believe that Magni 3+ has a place. But when it comes down to it, it’s your call.\n\nWhy is it a “Magni 3+” and not a “Magni 4?”\n\nWhy is it a 6S or 8 but not 9 or 10S but 11? Nah, sorry, just teasing you, Apple fans. There’s a method to our madness. For us, a product gets a “+” when it has the same functionality, but has been changed significantly internally. Like Freya+ and Saga+. A product gets a number bump if the functionality changes.\n\nSo which one is quiet enough for IEMs?\n\nBoth of them will run IEMs with zero audible noise, though Magni Heresy is slightly quieter on the analyzer.\n\nSo which one is powerful enough for inefficient, planar magnetic headphones?\n\nBoth of them have tons of power—specifically 2.4W RMS per channel at less than 1% THD, though both typically perform comfortably above that.\n\nHow do you keep getting more and more power out of Magni with every iteration?\n\nSimple: we keep tweaking for higher efficiency. Last time it was a topology change. This time it’s a driver stage and optimized emitter resistance. It is about the maximum of what we can do now, though, without giant changes.\n\nWhat’s this about DC coupling?\n\nEither Magni has no capacitors in the signal path at all—that’s what we mean by DC coupling. This eliminates any sonic effect a capacitor in the signal path might have on your system.\n\nSo you probably cheaped out and left the protection off these amps, or something stupid like that, right?\n\nNo. Both Magnis have relay mute for delayed startup and fast shut-down. You can leave your headphones plugged in all the time. It also automatically disconnects the preamp outputs when you plug headphones in. Amazing things, switches.\n\nThese sound so great! Why would I buy any of your other amps?\n\nSeriously, you really don’t need to. But, you know, different people like different things, and they may want to try out tube amps, or balanced amps, or Class A/Continuity™ amps, or you might have Raal/Requisite headphones, and then you actually need a different amp, the Jotunheim R, the only direct drive ribbon headphone amp.\n\nI want a combined DAC/amp! Why didn’t you put a DAC in here?\n\nWe did. They’re just in a different chassis and costs another $99-249. They’re called “Modi 3” or “Modi Multibit.”\n\nHey, so does that mean I can plug in some uber-special, gold-plated, cryo-treated, 85-lb 2000VA wall wart and have even better performance?\n\nUnless you know what you’re doing, we don’t recommend that. Magni uses an AC wall wart. Most are DC. DC won’t work with either Magni. Plus, seriously? This is a $99 amp. You want to use some $599 power supply with it? Nah.\n\nWhat the hell is a Magni?\n\nIn Norse mythology, Magni was one of Thor’s sons.\n\nDOWNLOADS\nSchiit Magni 3+/Heresy Manual\nMagni 3+/Heresy Chapter (from the ongoing Schiit Happened book)\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n2 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Schiit Magni comes with a 2 year warranty from Schiit that covers manufacturing defects.

Schiit Loki\n\n2. Wall-Wart\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the difference between the Schiit Loki and other equalizers?\n\nThe Schiit Loki is a lot more sleeker, transparent and flexible than other equalizers. Of course, if you still prefer the old noisy ones with dusty sliders; we are not judging.\n\nWhat kind of an equalizer is this?\n\nThe Schiit Loki is a single-gain-stage active equalizer. It also has non-constant-Q passive filtering. Translation: Each band in this equalizer changes from broad to narrow as the gain is increased.\n\nWill it give me a more true-to-life sound?\n\nThe Loki can fine-tune your audio to make it better. Whether it can sound like a recording artist in a studio? Hmmm.....It depends on what you are listening to and how much bass/treble you need.\n\nCan I bypass it entirely if I get it?\n\nAfter connecting it, you can bypass the equalizer simply by switching the switch in front. We did say it ranks high on transparency.\n\nIs it portable?\n\nConsidering you need to connect it to a power outlet, we wouldn’t really recommend it as an on-the-go device.\n\nNow hold on just a sec—are you saying we should use equalizers now?\n\nNope, you’re saying that. Not us.\n\nBut you just brought out this product!\n\nRight. And, as you’ll note, it’s a standalone product. You can add it to your system if you’d like, or act like it doesn’t exist. It won’t add itself to your cart if you happen to buy, say, a Modi Multibit (or anything else.)\n\nBuuuutttt…we thought you were crazy minimalist audiophile types who’d put their nose up in the air at the very thought of EQ?\n\nAs with the previous question, there’s nothing stopping you from assembling a minimalist, no-tone-control system from our extensive product line. Adding Loki is a choice you can make. If you’d like. No pressure.\n\nSo why bring this out now? What changed?\n\nThe world changed, and we decided to experiment a bit. That’s it in a nutshell. The longer explanation includes the fact that tone controls have pretty much become verboten over the last three decades in high-end audio. For those of you who remember some crappy tone control and EQ implementations, including dull, veiled, nasty-sounding knobs on the front of receivers and noisy, truly awful-sounding banks of 10 to 30 sliders (usually fixed in a death-grin), you know that there’s a good reason tone controls went away. But we decided to take a look at it and see what we could make with a single gain stage (rather than 10-30 op-amps in a row) and using passive LC (inductor-capacitor) filtering wherever possible. And we found that we could create an extremely transparent equalizer that allowed for some very nice control over tonal characteristics, without the downside of traditional tone controls or EQs. So we decided to make it and see if you find it interesting as well.\n\nBut…why EQ?\n\nBecause we live in an imperfect world, and because individuals have individual preferences. Nobody can say their speakers or headphones are ruler-flat. Nobody can say that all of their recordings are audiophile-quality. Loki provides a way to adjust for imperfect systems and imperfect recordings.\n\nBut…buuuuttt…is this true to the original recording? Is it what the artist intended?\n\nIf it sounds good to you, who cares?\n\nAieeeee! You’re making my head hurt! I don’t like options!\n\nCool. Then don’t get a Loki. Nobody’s making you buy it.\n\nWell, if I do get it, can I bypass it?\n\nYes. There’s a switch on the front to completely bypass the tone control stage—as in, a relay connects the input and output directly, no active devices in the signal path at all.\n\nWow, so I guess you guys really think this is transparent, if it’s that easy to A-B the input and output.\n\nYes, we do think Loki is very transparent.\n\nLet’s talk tech. What kind of EQ is this? Parametric?\n\nNo. Technically, Loki is a single-gain-stage active EQ with non-constant-Q passive filtering. In more English-y terms, that means that each band varies from broad to narrower as its gain is increased—small turns of the knobs result in broad, shallow changes, and bigger turns result in more narrow-band changes.\n\nThis gain stage, is it like Jotunheim’s Pivot Point topology?\n\nIt’s similar, yes, in that it is a fully discrete, current-feedback topology, but it is single-ended.\n\nWhoa. Wait a sec, are you saying you’re giving us a discrete, single-gain-stage, passive LC-filtered EQ, the most purist approach to tone controls…for $149? Are you nuts?\n\nWe do like high value, but we’re not crazy. At least not as an official diagnosis.\n\nWhat if I want a constant-Q EQ, or a parametric EQ?\n\nThat’s cool. There are some of those out there. They just won’t be Loki.\n\nWhat about software EQ?\n\nIf you’d like to use software EQ (supplied with many playback software packages these days), that’s certainly an option—and you can probably get your parametric EQ there, if that’s what you want. However, you may prefer Loki…and once you get away from a computer source, an external hardware EQ is necessary if you want tone control.\n\nWhat about the name, you’re re-using that, right?\n\nYep! Loki is the trickster god in Norse mythology. And it’s a neat name for a tricky little product. Now that we’re off the DSD train, it’s perfect for reviving a whole new category of products.\n\nI noticed on the PC board you’re calling this Loki Mini. Are there other Lokis coming?\n\nCome on, now, you know we don’t discuss future products. However, we’re always open to expanding the line in meaningful ways if this model does well—including coming up with a family of Lokis with different capabilities and at different price points.

Schiit Magni Heresy\n\n2. Wall-Wart 15VAC, 1.5A\n\nFAQs\n\nWait a sec, there are two Magnis now? Why U make me choose?!?\n\nBecause some people really like our historic approach to Magni, and some people want even better measurements. So we decided to give you both: a Magni 3+ that is the ultimate expression of our discrete, current-feedback topology (basically a small speaker amp) and a Magni Heresy that is 100% integrated—all op-amps, all the time..\n\nWhy would I choose one over the other?\n\nBecause you like silver and gray, which is the finish of Magni 3+, or black and red, which are Magni Heresy's colors.\n\nNo, seriously!\n\nI think we covered this in the product description, but here goes again, with more detail ● Magni 3+: choose this one if you want an all-discrete headphone amp. Discrete means its made up of lots of individual transistors (well, actually a lot of paired matched transistors now). It’s essentially a mini speaker amp. In fact, the topology is exactly that of a 2-stage speaker amp now, since we added a driver stage and Vbe multiplier for biasing. The driver reduces distortion and the Vbe multiplier means the bias is more stable. It's a super-advanced amp, and we’re very proud of it. ● Magni Heresy: choose this one if you want a 100% op-amp-based headphone amp that delivers spectacular measurements. Thank the high-quality op-amps used: OPA1662 for gain, OPA1688 for output—eight (8) OPA1688 stages per channel, for low output impedance and very high current capability. With these advanced parts (the OPA1688 even uses feedforward in its topology), we’re getting 6-8dB lower THD+N than Magni 3+, which is already 10-15dB lower THD+N than Magni 3.\n\nWhich one sounds better?\n\nAh hell no, we aren’t falling for that. You tell us.\n\nAt least give us a hint!\n\nWe think both amps sound very, very good, or else we wouldn’t offer both of them. We developed the Magni Heresy largely to see what could be accomplished with a simple topology and modern op-amps, but we’re very pleased with the way it came out. At the same time, we think Magni 3+ provides compelling reasons that you shouldn’t choose everything simply based on numbers. But seriously, you tell us.\n\nWhy the name “Heresy?”\n\nWhen we started developing an all-op-amp Magni, it was 100% counter to everything we’ve done. We’ve always done fully discrete designs, when we weren’t so cost-constrained that they weren’t practical. Going op-amp was far, far easier, and more typical in today’s world, but it was, well, almost anathema. So to us, an op-amp Magni was heresy. But we’re happy with the way it turned out!\n\nIf Heresy is so good, why’d you bother with Magni 3+?\n\nThat’s a great question, isn’t it? Why would we bother with a much more complex, harder to produce product that takes a lot more engineering time and skill (the Magni 3+)? Well, we believe that the numbers don’t tell the entire story. We believe that Magni 3+ has a place. But when it comes down to it, it’s your call.\n\nWhy is it a “Magni 3+” and not a “Magni 4?”\n\nWhy is it a 6S or 8 but not 9 or 10S but 11? Nah, sorry, just teasing you, Apple fans. There’s a method to our madness. For us, a product gets a “+” when it has the same functionality, but has been changed significantly internally. Like Freya+ and Saga+. A product gets a number bump if the functionality changes.\n\nSo which one is quiet enough for IEMs?\n\nBoth of them will run IEMs with zero audible noise, though Magni Heresy is slightly quieter on the analyzer.\n\nSo which one is powerful enough for inefficient, planar magnetic headphones?\n\nBoth of them have tons of power—specifically 2.4W RMS per channel at less than 1% THD, though both typically perform comfortably above that.\n\nHow do you keep getting more and more power out of Magni with every iteration?\n\nSimple: we keep tweaking for higher efficiency. Last time it was a topology change. This time it’s a driver stage and optimized emitter resistance. It is about the maximum of what we can do now, though, without giant changes.\n\nWhat’s this about DC coupling?\n\nEither Magni has no capacitors in the signal path at all—that’s what we mean by DC coupling. This eliminates any sonic effect a capacitor in the signal path might have on your system.\n\nSo you probably cheaped out and left the protection off these amps, or something stupid like that, right?\n\nNo. Both Magnis have relay mute for delayed startup and fast shut-down. You can leave your headphones plugged in all the time. It also automatically disconnects the preamp outputs when you plug headphones in. Amazing things, switches.\n\nThese sound so great! Why would I buy any of your other amps?\n\nSeriously, you really don’t need to. But, you know, different people like different things, and they may want to try out tube amps, or balanced amps, or Class A/Continuity™ amps, or you might have Raal/Requisite headphones, and then you actually need a different amp, the Jotunheim R, the only direct drive ribbon headphone amp.\n\nI want a combined DAC/amp! Why didn’t you put a DAC in here?\n\nWe did. They’re just in a different chassis and costs another $99-249. They’re called “Modi 3” or “Modi Multibit.”\n\nHey, so does that mean I can plug in some uber-special, gold-plated, cryo-treated, 85-lb 2000VA wall wart and have even better performance?\n\nUnless you know what you’re doing, we don’t recommend that. Magni uses an AC wall wart. Most are DC. DC won’t work with either Magni. Plus, seriously? This is a $99 amp. You want to use some $599 power supply with it? Nah.\n\nWhat the hell is a Magni?\n\nIn Norse mythology, Magni was one of Thor’s sons.\n\nDOWNLOADS\nSchiit Magni 3+/Heresy Manual\nMagni 3+/Heresy Chapter (from the ongoing Schiit Happened book)\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n2 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Schiit Magni comes with a 2 year warranty from Schiit that covers manufacturing defects.

The bass and warmth that you'd expect from an Audeze make them ideal for anyone starting their journey and looking for serious high-end headphones. Pair it with a good desktop Amp to make them sing.\n\nRAGHAV SOMANI\nHeadphone Guru\n\nAbout Raghav Somani\nRaghav Somani is the Founder & CEO of Headphone Zone. An avid audiophile and musician since 2008, his choice of headphones include STAX Electrostats, Audeze LCD 3, and for music on the go, the JH Audio Roxanne + Astell&Kern SP1000 is never too far away. On his playlist, you'll find A.R. Rahman, Michael Jackson, and the Eagles.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nNEW HEADPHONE, SAME SOUND\n\nWhat do you get when you take the LCD-2's drivers and remove the Fazor elements? The warm and energetic sound of the Audeze LCD-2 Classic. Seeing the popularity of the original LCD-2, Audeze decided to bring it back in a new & improved version — the LCD-2 Classic.\n\nAUDEZE'S PLANAR MAGNETIC MAGIC\n\nUnlike a dynamic driver with a cone or dome attached to a round voice coil, Audeze's flat, thin-film diaphragm has a printed circuit across most of its surface. When the circuit is energized with an audio signal it interacts with the magnets that move the diaphragm back and forth, creating a larger than life sound. Further, the double-sided magnet arrays deliver a uniform driving force across the entire diaphragm for a near-zero distortion.\n\nHANDCRAFTED WITH PREMIUM MATERIALS\n\nMade in the USA, the Audeze LCD-2 Classic are handcrafted using high-quality luxurious materials. It features Audeze's tonal balance and powerful bass that beautifully articulates the power and nuance of your favourite music. The gorgeous wooden rings are designed for the audiophile with a discerning ear & style.\n\nMIX & MASTER ANYWHERE & EVERYWHERE\n\nNot everyone can listen to their headphones in an acoustically treated room.

It produces a sound that would only be comparable to other loudspeakers (& not headphones). Hence, it is only fair that this headset be called an Earspeaker. Keeping in line with its predecessors, the SR-L300 has top notch sound quality. Stainless photo etched electrodes are fixed securely for a clear transparent audio. The headphone gives a balanced sound with delicate highs, soothing mids and a deep bass.\n\nWHY ELECTROSTATIC HEADPHONES?, LET YOUR MUSIC SOUND ITS BEST\n\nElectrostatic designed have been pioneered by Stax and they are clearly at the top of the game. The electrostatic headphones operate on a an unconventional level unlike other headphones that feature dynamic and moving coil designs. In most headphones, the drivers are heavier, making it difficult to recreate detail in playback due to mass. To keep the quality of music from deteriorating, the Stax SR-L300 uses an Oxygen Free Copper (OFC). This cable uses a wide flat structure to reduce the capacitance between wires and to drive it effectively so that your music always sounds its best.\n\nARTIFICIAL LEATHER EARPADS, EXTREME COMFORT\n\nEverything about the SR-L300 is made to enhance the sound and your listening experience. This also includes the artificial leather earpads. The flexibility of these earpads provides added comfort while letting you feel the freshness of your music. The SR-L300 is made for comfortable listening. The stepless slider mechanism, lets you adjust the soft headpad for a better fit. This avoids fatigue and enables you to entirely immerse yourself in the music.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n7 - 41,000Hz\n\nSENSITIVITY\n101dB / 100V R.m.s. 1 KHz\n\nBIAS VOLTAGE\n580V DC\n\nIMPEDANCE\n145kΩ (including attached cable, at 10kHz)\n\nCAPICITANCE\n110pF (Including Cable)\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nLEFT AND RIGHT CHANNEL IDENTIFICATION\n'L' And 'R' Indicated On The Arc Assembly, Solid Line (Left) And Dotted Line (Right) On Cable\n\nAMBIENT TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY\n0 To 35ºC / 90% Max.

    "description": "DESCRIPTION\nWe conducted a survey and found that over 88% of headphone owners didn't have a dedicated place to keep their expensive headphones. While some resigned to seeing their headphones casually strewn over a desk, a large portion of our study showed that headphones are well hidden away from view, either in a drawer, or packed neatly in their hard cases or packaging.\nThe question was on everyone's mind.\"How do I make my headphones more accessible?\" Headphones are a prized possession and we found that one should take pride in presenting them.\nThat's when we decided to recreate the elegant Omega SE Headphone Stand, a handcrafted detachable wooden stand available in two different wooden finishes: Birch and Walnut.\nA Headphone Zone product, we're confident that this stand is definitely going to change the look of your table top.\nDetachable and Portable headphone stand\nOmega SE is made detachable so that you can carry your stand anywhere and everywhere. It's lightweight and portable so that it's easy to carry.\nHandcrafted Luxury\nThe Omega SE stand is handcrafted from wood that is sourced from sustainably forested woodland. It is quite heavy to hold and feels durable to the touch.\nShaped like an Omega\nThe conturing shape of the Omega SE resembles the natural shape of a human head. This means, that one needn't worry about the headphone's structure being altered or degraded over time.\nFit for all Headphones\nAll headphones, large or small can enjoy the luxury of this stand. These easily take the weight of all headphones, and also complement most of them.\nBirch Wood Finish\nBirch wood finishes, often a substitute for maple wood, are a very popular craftwood option for its smooth lines and soft colours. It's very easy on the eyes. We love the wonderful fine and uniform texture.\n\nWalnut Wood Finish\nThis beautiful dark wood stand is easily one of the most alluring. Typically found in music instruments and super plush furniture, walnut is a popular choice for the architecture with fine taste. They'd complement most headphones.",

    "description": "DESCRIPTION\n\nTHE PERFECT MATCH FOR YOUR AUDIO GEAR\n\nDo you find that your headphones/ IEMs often have a background hiss from your source? All you need to do is connect the iFi Audio iEMatch to your headphone before plugging it into your source device and voila! You get a sound that's open & transparent. It is compatible with smartphones, PCs, DAPs and in-flight entertainment systems.\n\nBRINGS BACK LOST RESOLUTION\n\nUsually, at full volumes, music tends to lose at least 2-bits of resolution. The iEMatch brings back this lost resolution letting you increase the digital volume. It is compatible with all headphones and IEMS that use a 3.5mm, 2.5mm or 4.4mm jack. It comes with two sensitivity settings, High and Ultra Sensitivity to boost the sound.\n\nBALANCED OR SINGLE-ENDED? IT'S YOUR CHOICE\n\nThe iEMatch easily switches between balanced and single-ended headphones & IEMs. Headphones fitted with a TRRS jack can alternate between a balanced mode to match DAPs, DACs and headphone amplifiers while the single-ended mode is compatible with smartphones. The ‘S-Balanced®’ TRRS system by iFi provides a way to select the TRRS plug to offer either a balanced connection or a single-ended one.\n\nUSES ONLY HIGH-QUALITY MATERIALS\n\nThe iEMatch uses 6063-TS aluminium and a 6N silver copper matrix for better signal transfer. Durable gold-plated TRRS-Balanced connectors complete the package. You also get memory foam earplugs along with an aeroplane adapter and travel pouch for in-flight use.\n\nSPECS\n\nUSB3 Data\n\nULTRA SENSITIVITY\n-24dB\n\nHIGH-GAIN SENSITIVITY\n-12dB\n\nOPERATION\nTRRS-Balanced® for Single-Ended and Balanced operation\n\nBUILD\n6N silver/copper matrix wiring with FINAL 6063-T5 aluminium-magnesium alloy shell\n\nCOMPONENTS\nGold-plated printed circuit board with audiophile components (eg MELF resistors)\n\nCONNECTOR\nGold-plated 3.5mm male/female connectors Gold-plated 2.5mm male/female connectors Gold-plated 4.4mm male/female connectors\n\nINPUT IMPEDANCE\n2.5mm/3.5mm: 16 Ohm 4.4mm: < 40 Ohms (High-Sensitivity) < 50 Ohms (Ultra-Sensitivity)\n\nOUTPUT IMPEDANCE\n2.5mm/3.5mm: < 2.5 Ohms (High-Sensitivity) < 1 Ohms (Ultra-Sensitivity) 4.4mm: < 8.4 Ohms (High-Sensitivity) < 3.6 Ohms (Ultra-Sensitivity)\n\nWEIGHT\n2.5mm/3.5mm: 12.2g 4.4mm: 17.5g (0.62oz)\n\nLEGTH\n116mm\n\nIN THE BOX\n\n3.5MM\n\n1. iFi Audio iEMatch\n\n2.

    "description": "DESCRIPTION\nWe conducted a survey and found that over 88% of headphone owners didn't have a dedicated place to keep their expensive headphones. While some resigned to seeing their headphones casually strewn over a desk, a large portion of our study showed that headphones are well hidden away from view, either in a drawer, or packed neatly in their hard cases or packaging.\nThe question was on everyone's mind.\"How do I make my headphones more accessible?\" Headphones are a prized possession and we found that one should take pride in presenting them.\nThat's when we decided to recreate the elegant Omega SE Headphone Stand, a handcrafted detachable wooden stand available in two different wooden finishes: Birch and Walnut.\nA Headphone Zone product, we're confident that this stand is definitely going to change the look of your table top.\nDetachable and Portable headphone stand\nOmega SE is made detachable so that you can carry your stand anywhere and everywhere. It's lightweight and portable so that it's easy to carry.\nHandcrafted Luxury\nThe Omega SE stand is handcrafted from wood that is sourced from sustainably forested woodland. It is quite heavy to hold and feels durable to the touch.\nShaped like an Omega\nThe conturing shape of the Omega SE resembles the natural shape of a human head. This means, that one needn't worry about the headphone's structure being altered or degraded over time.\nFit for all Headphones\nAll headphones, large or small can enjoy the luxury of this stand. These easily take the weight of all headphones, and also complement most of them.\nBirch Wood Finish\nBirch wood finishes, often a substitute for maple wood, are a very popular craftwood option for its smooth lines and soft colours. It's very easy on the eyes. We love the wonderful fine and uniform texture.\n\nWalnut Wood Finish\nThis beautiful dark wood stand is easily one of the most alluring. Typically found in music instruments and super plush furniture, walnut is a popular choice for the architecture with fine taste. They'd complement most headphones.",

With these, Meze has worked to change the perception of headphones from being seen as technical devices or cheap plastic accessories to a mature product that you'll fall in love with.\n\nA RICH NATURAL SOUND\n\nEnjoy a crisp, balanced sound with the Meze 99 Classics. The 40mm neodymium drivers offer a clear, undistorted sound. Just sit back and put these on to enjoy the gorgeous sound of plucked strings, upbeat grooves or thumping beats that's natural and lifelike. In addition, the snug medium density memory foam keeps away noise while offering superior noise isolation.\n\nHIGH-QUALITY AND LUXURY IN EVERY ELEMENT\n\nApart from wood, the 99 Classics also use cast zinc and manganese spring steel. The headband ensures even pressure for long listening sessions. The headpad and earpads are made from PU leather. Everything is then put together using nuts and bolts. This makes the headphone fully serviceable. The entire headphone is made from only premium materials, no glue or plastic.\n\nMADE WITH CARE USING AN EXTENSIVE PROCESS\n\nEach Meze 99 Classics takes almost 45 days to be made. The wood used is harvested from mature trees that have reached the end of their life cycle. This ensures that there is no harm done to the environment while giving you that rich, natural sound. To further enhance the colours, the wood goes through extensive air drying and shaping by hand and CNC machines, a process that takes almost 8 hours. It then goes through sanding, lacquering, finishing, careful inspection and is finally assembled.\n\nSpecs\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVERS\n40mm\n\nIMPEDENCE\n32 Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n103 dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n15Hz - 25,000Hz\n\nRATED INPUT POWER\n30mW\n\nMAXIMUM INPUT POWER\n50mW\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTION\n3.5mm\n\nMICROPHONE\nYes\n\nREMOTE\n1-Button\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n260g\n\nGRILL\nClosed Back\n\nEAR-CUPS\nWalnut Wood\n\nCABLE\nKevlar OFC cable\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nWHAT YOU WILL GET\n\n1.

This headphone has been lovingly handcrafted from wood and the satin-finished wood grain makes each headphone unique, just like your fingerprint. With these, Meze has worked to change the perception of headphones from being seen as technical devices or cheap plastic accessories to a mature product that you'll fall in love with.\n\nA RICH NATURAL SOUND\n\nEnjoy a crisp, balanced sound with the Meze 99 Classics. The 40mm neodymium drivers offer a clear, undistorted sound. Just sit back and put these on to enjoy the gorgeous sound of plucked strings, upbeat grooves or thumping beats that's natural and lifelike. In addition, the snug medium density memory foam keeps away noise while offering superior noise isolation.\n\nHIGH-QUALITY AND LUXURY IN EVERY ELEMENT\n\nApart from wood, the 99 Classics also use cast zinc and manganese spring steel. The headband ensures even pressure for long listening sessions. The headpad and earpads are made from PU leather. Everything is then put together using nuts and bolts. This makes the headphone fully serviceable. The entire headphone is made from only premium materials, no glue or plastic.\n\nMADE WITH CARE USING AN EXTENSIVE PROCESS\n\nEach Meze 99 Classics takes almost 45 days to be made. The wood used is harvested from mature trees that have reached the end of their life cycle. This ensures that there is no harm done to the environment while giving you that rich, natural sound. To further enhance the colours, the wood goes through extensive air drying and shaping by hand and CNC machines, a process that takes almost 8 hours. It then goes through sanding, lacquering, finishing, careful inspection and is finally assembled.\n\nSpecs\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVERS\n40mm\n\nIMPEDENCE\n32 Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n103 dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n15Hz - 25,000Hz\n\nRATED INPUT POWER\n30mW\n\nMAXIMUM INPUT POWER\n50mW\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTION\n3.5mm\n\nMICROPHONE\nYes\n\nREMOTE\n1-Button\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n260g\n\nGRILL\nClosed Back\n\nEAR-CUPS\nWalnut Wood\n\nCABLE\nKevlar OFC cable\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nWHAT YOU WILL GET\n\n1.

This seems like a Fulla 2 with a microphone input!\n\nThat’s exactly what it is. A lot of people wanted a nice, transportable device for gaming, so we added a microphone input to Fulla 2 to make Fulla 3.\n\nBut it’s the same price as Fulla 2. What did you compromise on in order to add the mic input and keep the same price?\n\nWe have secret deals with the Chinese government, who actually make the Fulla 3 for us.\n\nReally?\n\nNo. Duh. We design and build everything here in California, just like we've done from the very start.\n\nSo do you care to answer the question?\n\nSure. The reason we could add the mic input—a really nice mic input, actually, with a 24-bit AKM ADC, automatic gain control, and full USB integration, so it just shows up on your list of inputs when you plug it in—is that times have changed, and we make more products more efficiently than ever before. So it doesn’t really cost much more to add the feature.\n\nAh come on! What did you compromise on?\n\nOnly one thing, really: we lost the fixed DAC output of Fulla 2 in order to accommodate the mic input. Now, there’s only a variable preamp output, with a marker for typical line-level output, rather than separate fixed and variable output. We think it’s a fairly good tradeoff. You may disagree.\n\nSo otherwise this is just a Fulla 2?\n\nYep. But let’s review what a Fulla 2 is, before you start throwing around that ‘just’ word. A Fulla 3, like Fulla 2, is a DAC/amp flexible enough to cover pretty much all your desktop needs. It has:\nA big-ass volume knob connected to a well-matched Alps RK09 pot (like we use in Magni)\nA 1/8” headphone output\nA 1/8” variable DAC output (so you can use it with powered monitors, or an amp without volume control)\nA 1/8” stereo analog input (so you can use it as just an amp, bypassing the DAC)\nA 1/8” mono electret mic input (so you can use it with most electret mics, both those attached to headphones and those that are separate)\nUSB micro inputs for both data/power and power alone (the second power input allows you to connect your phone charger or other 5V supply and bypass USB power.)\n\nSo how does this thing work for gaming?\n\nPlug in your headphones and mic (usually using the TRRS-to-dual-TRS adapter supplied with the headphones), plug the Fulla 3 into your computer, select “I’m Fulla Schiit” for both audio output and mic input, and you’re set. Done.\n\nSounds like this is for PCs. How about for consoles?\n\nIf your console supports UAC2 (USB Audio Class 2, the standard for USB audio these days), then you’re golden. However, we haven’t tested all consoles. But for Windows 10, most Linux distros, MacOS, iOS, and Android these days, you’re set.\n\nWhat about Windows 7 and 8.1?\n\nWe provide drivers for this antique version of Windows that is slated to die in January 2020, and for 8.1. Seriously, though, Windows 10 is really good. Time to move on.\n\nOkay. Fine. Let’s talk power. Are you saying that if I plug my phone charger into the power-only USB input, that means the Fulla 3 tells my computer that it doesn’t need any power?\n\nYes. Or your phone, or tablet, or any other device plugged into the Data/Power USB port. Technically, Fulla 3 tells your computer or phone it needs the full 500mA a USB2 port can supply, unless you plug in a separate power USB, in which case, it tells your computer or phone that it needs 0mA.\n\nSo, also on this USB power thing, does that mean I can use a super-crazy linear supply that costs 3X as much as the Fulla 3 to get better performance?\n\nGo back and read what you just asked. Seriously, just use your phone charger or something.\n\nYeah, I hear you, but I really really really want to spend a lot of money on a linear power supply that does nothing!\n\nWe understand. And you should be free to waste your money any way you'd like. But really, your super-pristine linear supply with the Regurgitson Ultraregulators isn't gonna do anything, since it's running through a switching supply anyway. You know, just like lots of other, more expensive products do...except we tell you this, and don't encourage you to throw money down the loo.\n\nSo I can use this with iDevices and Android phones with no powered hub?\n\nMany of them, yes. As long as you have a 5V charger of reasonable quality with a micro USB connector for output. You know, like for charging phones. However, note that Android devices are highly variable—just because they're running the latest OS doesn't mean the hardware is up to the task. Some will need helper software like UAPP.\n\nCan I use this with both headphones and powered monitors?\n\nYep!\n\nCan I use this as just an amp?\n\nYep!\n\nCan I use this as just a DAC?\n\nYep! It has variable output, with a marker for typical line-level output.\n\nIf I plug in headphones…\n\nIt automatically mutes the preamp outputs. See, we’re getting good at predicting what you’re gonna ask. Kinda like autocorrect. But with less embarrassing mistakes. We hope.\n\nWhoa. That’s a whole lot of features! How do you do it for $99 in the USA?\n\nBy making tons of them, selling direct, and not being greedy.\n\nHey, I want one of these in silver, not black.\n\nSorry, only black is available on Fulla 3. Come to the dark side...\n\nWhy would I step up to a Hel?\n\nBecause you want more power or flexibility. Hel delivers 4x the power of Fulla 3, it has a gain switch for harder-to-drive or more sensitive headphones, it has a switchable analog input, and it has front-panel adjustable microphone gain and a stereo mic input. If any of those features are important, it might be worth $90 more than Fulla 3 for your needs.\n\nSo why would I step up to a Magni/Modi stack?\n\nMore power, more flexibility, bigger wallet, bigger desk—remember, Magni/Modi/Vali combos range from $198 to $398, and cover basic USB-powered DACs to True Multibit DACs, solid-state to tube amps. Also, they don’t provide microphone input for gaming.\n\nSo is this gonna sound great with my headphones?\n\nFor most headphones, yes. There are some headphones out there that are very hard to drive, or insanely sensitive. Check with the headphone manufacturer if you're unsure.\n\nIs 400mW into 16 ohms a lot of power?\n\nWell, you’re not going to arc-weld with it or anything, but it is about 10x the output power of a typical headphone jack on a computer or mobile device.\n\nWhat comes in the box, besides the Fulla? Do I get a cable with this?\n\nYes, we supply a 3’ micro USB (to standard USB) cable. Yeah, we know Apple and some other doods are going full-nuts on USB-C. One word: adapters.\n\nWhat about the 1/8” to XLR, or 1/8” to RCA, or 1/8” to 1/8”, or 1/8” to DIN, or whatever cables I need to connect to my speakers or DACs?\n\nThat’s a lot of cables. And this thing is $99. Check out Monoprice for 1/8\" to dual RCA cables and all the other crazy cables you might need.\n\nCan I use a fancier cable to get better sound?\n\nYou can do whatever you’d like, including dancing by the light of the full moon and making small, non-living sacrifices to the audiophile gods.\n\nNo, seriously.\n\nWe are being serious.\n\nI’m asking specifically about the cable.\n\nAs long as it’s a USB 2.0-rated cable, 2m or less in length, terminated with a micro USB plug on one end, you can use it, sure.\n\nAnd it’ll sound better?\n\nProbably about as much as taping $100 bills to your headphones. Or sending the $100 bills to us. We prefer the latter.\n\nYou’re messing with me!\n\nJust a little.\n\nSo what’s Fulla in Norse?\n\nFulla is a goddess, “bountiful”, and a healer. And if you’re looking to relax to some great tunes on the go, the Schiit Fulla can definitely be a bountiful healer. And that’s not fulla schiit.\n\nBuying Guide\n\nBest Amp/DACs for your Headphones for Beginner Audiophiles\nby Shanth Swaroop May 09, 2020\nThere are many kinds of DACs available at different price points.

Pick the Multibit DAC Module to get Schiit’s multi-bit DAC architecture & unique digital filter or the AK4490 DAC Module for a world-class delta-sigma DAC or even MM Phono Input Module, for passive RIAA, 42dB of gain & great phono sound.\n\nEXCELLENT PERFORMANCE, ALWAYS\n\nThe Jotunheim's gain stage is unique. Without using summers or splitters, it offers a balanced and single-ended output thanks to its inherently balanced & fully discrete current feedback topology. You get the advantage of constant, low feedback throughout the audio band with its wide bandwidth and excellent measured performance. The bottom line? Superb performance from each input & output.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nMAXIMUM POWER (BALANCED HEADPHONE OUTPUT)\n7500mW RMS per channel (16 ohms) 5000mW RMS per channel (32 ohms) 3000mW RMS per channel (50 ohms) 900mW RMS per channel (300 ohms) 500mW RMS per channel (600 ohms)\n\nMAXIMUM POWER (SINGLE-ENDED HEADPHONE OUTPUT)\n2500mW RMS per channel (16 ohms) 1500mW RMS per channel (32 ohms) 800mW RMS per channel (50 ohms) 350mW RMS per channel (300 ohms) 175mW RMS per channel (600 ohms)\n\nTHD\n< 0.001%, 20Hz-20KHz, at 1V RMS\n\nIMD\n< 0.0015%, CCIR\n\nSNR\n109db, A-weighted, referenced to 1V RMS\n\nCROSSTALK\n-70dB, 20 Hz-20KHz\n\nOUTPUT IMPEDANCE\nLess than 0.1 ohms, balanced or SE, at both gain settings\n\nINPUT IMPEDANCE\n50K ohms\n\nGAIN\n2 (6dB) or 8 (18dB), selectable via front switch\n\nINPUTS\nBalanced XLR and Single-Ended RCA, selectable via front switch\n\nOUTPUTS\nBalanced headphone (4-pin XLR), single-ended headphone (1/4” TRS), balanced line preamp, single-ended line preamp\n\nOPTIONAL OUTPUTS\nMultibit DAC, AK4490 DAC, or Passive MM Phono\n\nGAIN STAGE\nProprietary Schiit Pivot Point™ fully discrete differential current-feedback topology\n\nPOWER SUPPLY\nOne 48VA transformer with 6 stages of discrete or integrated regulation and over 70,000uF total filter capacitance\n\nOPTIONAL DUAL AK4490 DAC\n\nUSB INPUT RECEIVER\nC-Media CM6631A\n\nD/A CONVERSION IC\nAK4490 x 2Input Capability: up to 24/192\n\nANALOG OUTPUT\nFully differential, active summing and filtering\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n20Hz-20KHz, +/-0.1dB 2-100kHz, -3dB\n\nTHD\n<0.001%, 20Hz-20KHz, full scale\n\nIMD\n<0.001%, CCIR\n\nS/N\n108dB, referenced to 2V RMS, unweighted\n\nOPTIONAL MULTIBIT DAC\n\nUSB INPUT RECEIVER\nC-Media CM6631A\n\nD/A CONVERSION IC\nAnalog Devices AD5547\n\nDIGITAL FILTER\nSchiit Comboburrito Time- and Frequency-domain Optimized DSP filter\n\nInput Capability\nup to 24/192\n\nAnalog Output\nFully differential, active summing and filtering\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n20Hz-20KHz, +/-0.25dB 2-100kHz, -3dB\n\nTHD\n<0.005%, 20Hz-20KHz, full scale\n\nIMD\n<0.006%, CCIR\n\nS/N\n109dB, referenced to 2V RMS, unweighted\n\nOPTIONAL PASSIVE FILTERED PHONO STAGE\n\nGAIN\n42dB\n\nTHD\n<0.01%, A-weighted, at 1V RMS\n\nSNR\n80dB, A-weighted, inputs shorted\n\nCROSSTALK\n-70dB, 20-20kHz\n\nSENSITIVITY\n2.3mV for 400mV output\n\nOVERLOAD MARGIN\n20dB\n\nINPUT IMPEDANCE\n47k ohms\n\nINPUT CAPACITANCE\n100pf\n\nRIAA ACCURACY:\n+/- 0.25dB, 20-20kHz\n\nTOPOLOGY\nFully passive RIAA network with AD8599 gain stages and PET film capacitors throughout, DC coupled, with DC servo\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\nSchiit - Jotunheim\n\nFAQs\n\nI thought you guys said you’d never do a DAC/Amp!\n\nThis isn’t a DAC/amp. This is a configurable desktop control center.\n\nBut if you choose the DAC card, it’s a DAC/amp!\n\nYep, it is. And if you choose a different card, or no card, it’s a phono/amp or just an amp/preamp. The main point is that it doesn’t have to be a DAC/amp.\n\nI don’t see the difference.\n\nHere’s the difference: buy a DAC/amp that isn’t modular and upgradable, and you’ll be chucking it in the can in a couple of years when digital technology changes. With Jotunheim, you just swap in a new DAC card. Or decide, “heck with it, let’s do phono now.” Or never have a DAC. Or never have a phono. It’s up to you…and it’s updatable for the future…and it’s got a modular slot that, well, who knows what we’ll decide to put in it next?\n\nBut you said amp/DACs were inferior!\n\nNope. We said we didn’t like combined products due to obsolescence, and we didn’t like a noisy DAC section sharing power supplies with an amp. We killed the obsolescence issue with modular architecture, and we’ve gone to huge lengths to isolate the Jotunheim’s amp section from digital noise, including RF-suppressing, 4-layer board layout and multiple isolated, regulated supplies. Boom. Problems solved.\n\nHoly hell, this thing is cheap for a real balanced differential amp/DAC!\n\nWell, maybe not in the grand scheme of things. I mean, you can get a decent laptop for what Jotunheim costs. But yes, we are very proud of the value we’ve been able to pack into Jotunheim. An all-new, proprietary Pivot Point™ differential discrete topology, multiple switchable inputs and preamp outputs, balanced and single-ended headphone outs, a big 27mm Alps 4-gang balanced pot, and an optional differential DAC module with passive filtering. And a ton of power. And a 5-year warranty. And…but we’re getting tedious, aren’t we?\n\nBut this is probably a “fake” balanced amp, right, where you convert from balanced to single-ended and back again?\n\nNope. When we say, “balanced, differential,” we say what we mean, and mean what we say.\n\nWait a sec, there are a lot of combined amp/DACs out there using op-amps and digital volume, or converting to single-ended internally, or all of the above, that cost a whole lot more than this, right?\n\nRight.\n\nAaaannd?\n\nAnd they ain’t Schiit.\n\nSo, if we get a DAC module, is this an amp/DAC or DAC/amp?\n\nYes.\n\nAnd how did you achieve this magical no-compromise bullschiit?\n\nBy not simply sticking a headphone amp chip in a DAC or sticking a half-assed DAC in a headphone amp. Used as a DAC, it operates no differently than Bifrost or Gungnir—but with the added functionality of a volume control, and, of course, a headphone output.\n\nSo I can use this as just a DAC?\n\nSure. If you get one of the optional DAC modules.\n\nWhat’s the difference between the DAC modules?\n\n$100.\n\nSheesh. Besides that, what’s the difference between the DAC modules?\n\nOkay, we’ll be serious. You can choose one of two different DAC modules for Jotunheim: Multibit DAC Module. This one uses Schiit’s unique DSP-based digital filter and true multibit DAC architecture, with the AK5547 D/A converter. It’s essentially a Modi Multibit with only USB input. AK4490 DAC Module. This one uses two AK4490 DACs (hardware-balanced configuration) for excellent measured performance at low cost.\n\nOr can I use it as just an amp?\n\nYep, you can do that too. You can also use it as a great preamp. And you can even use it as a phono preamp with the phono input card. You just can’t have both DAC and phono at the same time, sorry.\n\nWhat is this “Pivot Point topology?”\n\nIt’s a new, Schiit-proprietary, differential current-feedback topology that provides exceptional performance—low distortion, high bandwidth, inherently balanced output, and the ability to use one side of the topology as a single-ended output, to eliminate the need for summers. It’s also fully discrete, with no op-amps (except the DC servo) or integrated “chip” outputs, and is completely DC-coupled from input to output. It is, quite simply, the highest-performing, most flexible gain stage we’ve ever created. And it’s like nothing else out there.\n\nSo it’s not a circlotron?\n\nNo. It is inherently differential and balanced, but it is not a circlotron, nor is it supersymmetric. Beyond that, buy one and reverse-engineer it, like any other company with no imagination.\n\nI’m frustrated! I want to know everything about this magic gain stage!\n\nGo to college. Learn engineering. Be nice. Stop by at shows. Then maybe we’ll tell you more.\n\nYou’re screwing with me!\n\nYep. We probably won’t tell you anything, even at shows. Yes, I know, we’re dinosaurs in this open-source age.\n\nHey, this isn’t the same old Schiit chassis you’ve been using forever. What gives?\n\nOh, you noticed. This new, more efficient chassis is sleeker than our previous products, isn’t it? It’s also a big part of the Jotunheim’s attractive price. We’re not about putting the same old stuff in bejeweled boxes. In this case, there’s a whole lot of insanely-new-and-cool stuff in a very simple, affordable box.\n\nWhat’s Jotunheim in Norse mythology?\n\nIt’s the land of the giants. Which we believe is very appropriate for this all-new concept. But you tell us…\n\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n5 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Schiit Jotunheim comes with a 5 year warranty from Schiit that covers manufacturing defects. All products featured on Headphone Zone are backed by an original manufacturer's warranty.

The Schiit SYS, simply put, is a 2-way switch and potentiometer. This preamp contains neither the electronics nor the power you find in other Schiit products. But, thanks to this, you get absolutely no distortion.\n\nCONNECTS & SWITCHES BETWEEN ANY LINE-LEVEL SOURCE\n\nPair your DAC with a powered monitor or phono preamp and crank up the volume with the SYS. Need to use two sources with a Schiit amplifier? No worries. This preamp can switch between devices with ease. It can connect to just about any line-level source including PCs, iPods, Macs, DVD Players, tuners, etc.\n\nSPECS\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nNUMBER OF INPUTS\n2 (stereo RCA)\n\nNUMBER OF OUTPUTS\n1 (stereo RCA)\n\nINPUT IMPEDANCE\n10k ohms\n\nOUTPUT IMPEDANCE\n5k ohms maximum\n\nSIZE\n5 x 3.5 x 1.25”\n\nWEIGHT\n453g (1 lb)\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1. Schiit - SYS PreampStick-on feet\n\n2. Stick-on feet\n\nFAQs\n\nHey, this is cool! Can I use it between my DAC and a pair of powered monitors?\n\nYep, that's exactly what it's meant for\n\nHow about if I have a CD player, too?\n\nSure. Add it as a second input, and you can switch between them. Double the fun!\n\nHow about a phono preamp?\n\nYep, that works too. As do iPods, iPads, computers, Android phones, iPhones, Android tablets, Windows computers, Mac computers, DVD players, Blu-ray players, cassette players, tuners, digital radio receivers, or anything else with line-level output.\n\nCan I use it with a power amp?\n\nAbsolutely, you can use SYS to connect two sources to any power amp with RCA inputs, and control the volume.\n\nHey, I just want a switch, not volume control.\n\nTurn the volume all the way up and use the switch.\n\nHey, I just want volume control, not a switch.\n\nThen just use one input.\n\nHey, can you use this in reverse to switch 1 input to two outputs?\n\nYes, with the volume all the way up. But why not just use RCA Y-cables or splitters, like these?\n\nOkay, let's be serious. This is one cheap little gadget. What's the downside?\n\nThe downside to a passive preamp is exactly that—it's passive. That means there are no electronics in it. Which means it can't drive really long cable runs. If you're expecting to run 35' RCA cables to your power amp, Sys isn't going to be the best option. If you're running 6' cables to desktop speakers, that's not a problem. We'd be careful with anything longer than 15' on Sys, depending on the cable type.\n\nWarranty\n\n2 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Schiit SYS Preamp comes with a 2 year warranty from Schiit that covers manufacturing defects.

The Schiit SYS, simply put, is a 2-way switch and potentiometer. This preamp contains neither the electronics nor the power you find in other Schiit products. But, thanks to this, you get absolutely no distortion.\n\nCONNECTS & SWITCHES BETWEEN ANY LINE-LEVEL SOURCE\n\nPair your DAC with a powered monitor or phono preamp and crank up the volume with the SYS. Need to use two sources with a Schiit amplifier? No worries. This preamp can switch between devices with ease. It can connect to just about any line-level source including PCs, iPods, Macs, DVD Players, tuners, etc.\n\nSPECS\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nNUMBER OF INPUTS\n2 (stereo RCA)\n\nNUMBER OF OUTPUTS\n1 (stereo RCA)\n\nINPUT IMPEDANCE\n10k ohms\n\nOUTPUT IMPEDANCE\n5k ohms maximum\n\nSIZE\n5 x 3.5 x 1.25”\n\nWEIGHT\n453g (1 lb)\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1. Schiit - SYS PreampStick-on feet\n\n2. Stick-on feet\n\nFAQs\n\nHey, this is cool! Can I use it between my DAC and a pair of powered monitors?\n\nYep, that's exactly what it's meant for\n\nHow about if I have a CD player, too?\n\nSure. Add it as a second input, and you can switch between them. Double the fun!\n\nHow about a phono preamp?\n\nYep, that works too. As do iPods, iPads, computers, Android phones, iPhones, Android tablets, Windows computers, Mac computers, DVD players, Blu-ray players, cassette players, tuners, digital radio receivers, or anything else with line-level output.\n\nCan I use it with a power amp?\n\nAbsolutely, you can use SYS to connect two sources to any power amp with RCA inputs, and control the volume.\n\nHey, I just want a switch, not volume control.\n\nTurn the volume all the way up and use the switch.\n\nHey, I just want volume control, not a switch.\n\nThen just use one input.\n\nHey, can you use this in reverse to switch 1 input to two outputs?\n\nYes, with the volume all the way up. But why not just use RCA Y-cables or splitters, like these?\n\nOkay, let's be serious. This is one cheap little gadget. What's the downside?\n\nThe downside to a passive preamp is exactly that—it's passive. That means there are no electronics in it. Which means it can't drive really long cable runs. If you're expecting to run 35' RCA cables to your power amp, Sys isn't going to be the best option. If you're running 6' cables to desktop speakers, that's not a problem. We'd be careful with anything longer than 15' on Sys, depending on the cable type.\n\nWarranty\n\n2 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Schiit SYS Preamp comes with a 2 year warranty from Schiit that covers manufacturing defects.

The Schiit Jotunheim is meant to say 'goodbye' to this. You can use it as an internal DAC, amp or a phono preamp as well as upgrade it to anything else whenever needed. It's ready to handle sensitive IEMs, power-hungry headphones and powered desktop monitors with 5W output into 32 ohms from the balanced outputs.\n\nJUST THE WAY YOU LIKE IT\n\nTailor your Jotunheim exactly according to your needs. Pick the Multibit DAC Module to get Schiit’s multi-bit DAC architecture & unique digital filter or the AK4490 DAC Module for a world-class delta-sigma DAC or even MM Phono Input Module, for passive RIAA, 42dB of gain & great phono sound.\n\nEXCELLENT PERFORMANCE, ALWAYS\n\nThe Jotunheim's gain stage is unique. Without using summers or splitters, it offers a balanced and single-ended output thanks to its inherently balanced & fully discrete current feedback topology.

This is a configurable desktop control center.\n\nBut if you choose the DAC card, it’s a DAC/amp!\n\nYep, it is. And if you choose a different card, or no card, it’s a phono/amp or just an amp/preamp. The main point is that it doesn’t have to be a DAC/amp.\n\nI don’t see the difference.\n\nHere’s the difference: buy a DAC/amp that isn’t modular and upgradable, and you’ll be chucking it in the can in a couple of years when digital technology changes. With Jotunheim, you just swap in a new DAC card. Or decide, “heck with it, let’s do phono now.” Or never have a DAC. Or never have a phono. It’s up to you…and it’s updatable for the future…and it’s got a modular slot that, well, who knows what we’ll decide to put in it next?\n\nBut you said amp/DACs were inferior!\n\nNope. We said we didn’t like combined products due to obsolescence, and we didn’t like a noisy DAC section sharing power supplies with an amp. We killed the obsolescence issue with modular architecture, and we’ve gone to huge lengths to isolate the Jotunheim’s amp section from digital noise, including RF-suppressing, 4-layer board layout and multiple isolated, regulated supplies. Boom. Problems solved.\n\nHoly hell, this thing is cheap for a real balanced differential amp/DAC!\n\nWell, maybe not in the grand scheme of things. I mean, you can get a decent laptop for what Jotunheim costs. But yes, we are very proud of the value we’ve been able to pack into Jotunheim. An all-new, proprietary Pivot Point™ differential discrete topology, multiple switchable inputs and preamp outputs, balanced and single-ended headphone outs, a big 27mm Alps 4-gang balanced pot, and an optional differential DAC module with passive filtering. And a ton of power. And a 5-year warranty. And…but we’re getting tedious, aren’t we?\n\nBut this is probably a “fake” balanced amp, right, where you convert from balanced to single-ended and back again?\n\nNope. When we say, “balanced, differential,” we say what we mean, and mean what we say.\n\nWait a sec, there are a lot of combined amp/DACs out there using op-amps and digital volume, or converting to single-ended internally, or all of the above, that cost a whole lot more than this, right?\n\nRight.\n\nAaaannd?\n\nAnd they ain’t Schiit.\n\nSo, if we get a DAC module, is this an amp/DAC or DAC/amp?\n\nYes.\n\nAnd how did you achieve this magical no-compromise bullschiit?\n\nBy not simply sticking a headphone amp chip in a DAC or sticking a half-assed DAC in a headphone amp. Used as a DAC, it operates no differently than Bifrost or Gungnir—but with the added functionality of a volume control, and, of course, a headphone output.\n\nSo I can use this as just a DAC?\n\nSure. If you get one of the optional DAC modules.\n\nWhat’s the difference between the DAC modules?\n\n$100.\n\nSheesh. Besides that, what’s the difference between the DAC modules?\n\nOkay, we’ll be serious. You can choose one of two different DAC modules for Jotunheim: Multibit DAC Module. This one uses Schiit’s unique DSP-based digital filter and true multibit DAC architecture, with the AK5547 D/A converter. It’s essentially a Modi Multibit with only USB input. AK4490 DAC Module. This one uses two AK4490 DACs (hardware-balanced configuration) for excellent measured performance at low cost.\n\nOr can I use it as just an amp?\n\nYep, you can do that too. You can also use it as a great preamp. And you can even use it as a phono preamp with the phono input card. You just can’t have both DAC and phono at the same time, sorry.\n\nWhat is this “Pivot Point topology?”\n\nIt’s a new, Schiit-proprietary, differential current-feedback topology that provides exceptional performance—low distortion, high bandwidth, inherently balanced output, and the ability to use one side of the topology as a single-ended output, to eliminate the need for summers. It’s also fully discrete, with no op-amps (except the DC servo) or integrated “chip” outputs, and is completely DC-coupled from input to output. It is, quite simply, the highest-performing, most flexible gain stage we’ve ever created. And it’s like nothing else out there.\n\nSo it’s not a circlotron?\n\nNo. It is inherently differential and balanced, but it is not a circlotron, nor is it supersymmetric. Beyond that, buy one and reverse-engineer it, like any other company with no imagination.\n\nI’m frustrated! I want to know everything about this magic gain stage!\n\nGo to college. Learn engineering. Be nice. Stop by at shows. Then maybe we’ll tell you more.\n\nYou’re screwing with me!\n\nYep. We probably won’t tell you anything, even at shows. Yes, I know, we’re dinosaurs in this open-source age.\n\nHey, this isn’t the same old Schiit chassis you’ve been using forever. What gives?\n\nOh, you noticed. This new, more efficient chassis is sleeker than our previous products, isn’t it? It’s also a big part of the Jotunheim’s attractive price. We’re not about putting the same old stuff in bejeweled boxes. In this case, there’s a whole lot of insanely-new-and-cool stuff in a very simple, affordable box.\n\nWhat’s Jotunheim in Norse mythology?\n\nIt’s the land of the giants. Which we believe is very appropriate for this all-new concept. But you tell us…\n\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n5 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Schiit Jotunheim comes with a 5 year warranty from Schiit that covers manufacturing defects. All products featured on Headphone Zone are backed by an original manufacturer's warranty. Read more about Schiit's warranty in India.\n\n\"So if you already have a decent phono preamp or converter, all you need is the basic Jotunheim. You can use the Jotunheim with any stereo power amplifier to drive the speakers of your choice.\"\nRead More",

Thats the 99 Neo. And I absolutely love them. Its also tuned with a more laidback and warmer sound for a more modern signature.\n\nRAGHAV SOMANI\nHeadphone Guru\n\nAbout Raghav Somani\nRaghav Somani is the Founder & CEO of Headphone Zone. An avid audiophile and musician since 2008, his choice of headphones include STAX Electrostats, Audeze LCD 3, and for music on the go, the JH Audio Roxanne + Astell&Kern SP1000 is never too far away. On his playlist, you'll find A.R. Rahman, Michael Jackson, and the Eagles.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nA HEADPHONE THAT'S JUST AS SPECIAL AS YOU\n\nThe Meze 99 Neo is beautiful. Made from cast zinc alloy with a coal-black electroplated coating, it combines a contemporary black look with the best of the materials. The thickly padded memory earcups make a product that not only looks luxurious but also makes you feel special.\n\n40MM NEODYMIUM MAGNETS FOR A RICH, BALANCED SOUND\n\nA 40mm Neodymium magnet is placed on the side of each earcup and is designed to resonate in harmony providing a nice and wide soundstage. Rather than resorting to artificially tuned frequencies, the drivers provide dynamic contrast for a more natural listening experience.\n\nCOMFORTABLE FOR LONG LISTENING SESSIONS\n\nMeze has done exhaustive research in order to find the right material and technology for each component of the 99 Neo. To combat discomfort of any kind, the manganese spring steel headband delivers even pressure for any head size. The earcups consist of memory foam earpads and soft PU leather making these perfect for long listening sessions.\n\nBUILT TO BE STYLISH AND DURABLE\n\nThe headphones have cast zinc alloy hardware with an electroplated coating, stamped manganese spring steel headband and internal components are made of durable ABS and silicone parts. Construction uses no glue, just nuts and bolts. The cables are made with kevlar fibres, thereby combining the best of craftsmanship and sturdiness.\n\nSERVICEABLE IN EVERY PART\n\nThe Meze 99 Neo is built to last you generations with its replaceable parts and sturdy build. Besides the usual warranty that every brand offers, the 99 Neo's parts are endlessly serviceable. Each component can be easily substituted for another. So, if any part of the headphone is damaged you can simply replace it instead of going for a new pair of headphones.\n\nSPECS\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVER SIZE\n40mm\n\nIMPEDANCE\n26Ω\n\nSENSITIVITY\n103dB at 1KHz, 1mW\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n15Hz - 25kHz\n\nRATED INPUT POWER\n30mW\n\nMAXIMUM INPUT POWER\n50mW\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTION\n3.5mm gold plated\n\nMICROPHONE\nYes\n\nREMOTE\n1-Button\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n260g (without cables)\n\nGRILL\nClosed Back\n\nEAR CUPS\nABS Plastic\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

This kit is designed to remove the dust, oil and dirt that attaches itself to the ear pads and the headpad due to regular use. The cleanroom-quality Class 100 wipes are machine-washable and can be reused.\n\nHIGH-QUALITY INGREDIENTS TO KEEP YOUR LCD EARPADS & HEADBANDS SAFE\n\nUnlike regular leather conditioners that use toxic chemicals to cut costs, the special Audeze conditioner uses natural elements such as: Lanolin: A highly effective emollient that forms a protective film to keep the leather from drying. It has been derived from refined and purified sheep’s wool. Aloe Vera: Is used with coconut oil to repair the leather and preserve its texture. It nourishes the leather fibres for a longer life and a softer feel. It is known as one of nature’s best moisturizers. Beeswax: Has excellent restorative properties. It is an expensive byproduct of honey production.100 pounds of honey produce only 1 to 2 pounds of beeswax. Carnauba Wax: Is sourced from the Carnauba palm tree growing in northeastern Brazil. The leaves are first collected, then dried and beaten to loosen the wax before being refined into the finished product. Note: While the conditioner is perfect to revitalise the leather headband and earpads, it can cause damage to non-leather bands and pads.\n\nIn the Box\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1. 2 Fl. oz.

It is the only system that makes it possible to listen to sound in the most ideal manner permitted by the balance system. The use of on-inductive coil resistance realises straightforward properties that take advantage of the fitted vacuum tubes and audio with outstanding quality and high level of clarity. STAX has ensured that SRM-007tll has put in great efforts into the circuit constants. Thus, it achieves a higher grade of reproductivity for SACD and other new generation audio formats.\n\nSPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR STAX ‘EARSPEAKERS’, ULTRA THIN POLYMER FILM & XLR AND ALL ANALOG VOICE INPUTS\n\nThe SRM-007tll has been exclusively designed for earspeakers characterized by their wide high dynamic range and outstanding operating features.

STAX SRM-007tII\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat sort of device is the STAX SRM-007tll? Why do I need it?\n\nThe STAX SRM-007tll is a driver unit. A driver unit is like an amplifier. It converts electrical signals from your audio player into music when it reaches your headphones. It is mainly used for headphones and earphones that have a high impedance. Find out more here.\n\nWhat are electrostatic earspeakers?\n\nElectrostatic earspeakers are headphones that run on special electrodes that conduct electricity. Since, these produce a sound that is only comparable with other loudspeakers (& not other headphones), they are known as earspeakers. Sounds cool right?\n\nWhat is the warranty like and whom should I contact?\n\nSTAX offers a manufacturer’s warranty of 1 year. In case you need to claim warranty or want to read more about it, here’s the place you need to be.\n\nWARRANTY AND MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this STAX SRM-007tII comes with a 1 year warranty from STAX that covers manufacturing defects. All products featured on Headphone Zone are backed by an original manufacturer's warranty. Read more about STAX's warranty in India.\n\n\"A high level of sound purity is achieved through the simple two-stage amplification circuit with low-noise FET input stage.

The titanium-coated acoustic fabric means that every knob movement on the mixing desk is audible. Subtle variations can be picked up like an acoustic magnifying glass.\n\nRUGGED BUILD AND REPLACEABLE COMPONENTS\n\nThe DT 1990 PRO is very durable.

For more warranty details click here.\n\nWhat is the difference between DT 1990 Pro and Amiron Home?\n\nAs a reference headphone for studio applications, the DT 1990 PRO features an accurate resolution and a differentiated stereo image. With a detailed reproduction of highs, it is the ideal tool for a precise analysis of the audio material to be processed. The Amiron home unfolds its full potential mainly at home. It combines a very precise bass with transparent mids and pleasantly clear highs. Its warm, laid-back sound with a fascinating spaciousness is excellently suitable for a relaxed listening to the music and provides a top-class audiophile listening experience..\n\nWhich plug is used for the detachable cable of DT 1770 / 1990 Pro?\n\nThis is a three-pin mini-XLR connection, the male part in the left earcup, the female one on the cable. Pressing the small button on the female plug unlocks the connection. The pin assignment is as follows: (3) - left hot, (2) - right hot, (1) - common return. The other end of the cable is equipped with a stereo minijack (1/8\") with a screwable 1/4\" adapter.\n\nWhat's the difference between the DT 770/990 Pro and the DT 1770/1990 Pro?\n\nThe DT 770/990 PRO is made for musicians, sound engineers, producers as well as beginners looking for a reliable, sturdy and affordable pair of headphones as a working device. The DT 1770/1990 PRO was developed for sound engineers, producers, and musicians looking for a pair of high-end studio headphones with uncompromising performance in all relevant aspects such as sound, design, comfort, and accessories.\n\nWhat do \"Impedance\" and \"Ohms\" mean?\n\nImpedance is the so-called alternating-current resistance that headphones have under specific standard conditions. On devices with low output impedance, headphones are the louder, the lower their impedance is. In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Ω, 32 Ω, and 80 Ω are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Ω are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Ω like the T 1.\n\nHow is the overall sound of Beyerdynamic - DT 1990 Pro?\n\nBeyerdynamic is a German brand that has made its mark as a fine headphone manufacturer and the DT 1990 Pro model gives a warm and smooth sound.\n\nDoes the Beyerdynamic - DT 1990 PRO come with a mic?\n\nNo, the Beyerdynamic DT 1990 Pro does not come with a mic since it is more of a studio monitoring headphone.\n\nIs the Beyerdynamic - DT 1990 PRO an over the ear or on the ear product?\n\nIt is a open-back over-the-ear headphone which makes listening to music better since it gives that natural sound output.\n\nHow is the overall fit of Beyerdynamic - DT 1990 PRO?\n\nBeyerdynamic - DT 1990 Pro fits over the ear and has plush earpads, making it a comfortable headphone to wear for long hours at a stretch.\n\nDoes the Beyerdynamic - DT 1990 PRO have detachable cables?\n\nYes, the cables are indeed detachable. Making for easy storage and convenient for whenever you want replace or upgrade cables.\n\nDoes the Beyerdynamic - DT 1990 PRO work well and loud enough with mobile phones ?\n\nIt gives enough output to be loud but then it also depends on your phone's internal amp and DAC\n\nAre the DT 1990 PRO good for long useage?\n\nYes, you can use the DT 1990 Pro for a long time as it comes with high-tech textiles, and memory foam filled ear pads ensure exceptional wearing comfort.\n\nDoes the Beyerdynamic - DT 1990 PRO need an Amplifier?\n\nYes, since it has a high impedence which cannot be driven by a smartphone an Amp gives it the extra boost to the sound.\n\nWARRANTY AND MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n2 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Beyerdynamic DT 1990 PRO comes with a 2 year warranty from Beyerdynamic that covers manufacturing defects.

(a network without a password)\n\nPoly can NOT connect to open networks. In order for Poly to connect to a network, the network must have at least an 8 character password. This is a minimum requirement for WPA-2 security.\n\nHow do I get started with Internet Radio?\n\nWith the latest firmware update (2.0.4), Internet Radio is supported. This is accessible from Gofigure’s home screen: tap LAUNCH RADIO to access the service, where you will find a small selection of get-you-started pre-installed streams. To add stations, simply type a station name in the Station Name field and paste the Internet Radio Station’s URL into the Station URL field, and tap ADD STATION. The station will then appear at the bottom of in the station list for playback. Pause and volume up/down controls are also offered.\n\nHow do I update Poly to Firmware version 2.0.0?\n\nPreparation\nPlease ensure before starting any of the following, that your Poly is charged and showing a solid P.status light. (not to be confused with the M.status which represents the Mojos battery status)\nPlease make sure your smartphone/device is fully up to date before beginning and you have the latest version of Gofigure.\nEnsure Poly is connected to a wifi connection with internet access. The update is quite large, so it needs a fast and reliable connection in order to download succesfully. Do not use mobile data or a mobile network to download the firmware.\nIn order to install 2.0.0, first your Poly must install a pre-update firmware 1.0.43. To complete this pre-update, leave your Poly connected to a Wi-Fi connection for twenty minutes, then switch off and unplug both Poly and Mojo until the P.status light has gone out. Then re-connect both Mojo and Poly, switching Mojo on. The Poly will have installed version 1.0.43 and is now ready to start the 2.0.0 download process located in the ‘device settings’ section of Gofigure.\nUpdating to 2.0.0 firmware\nStep 1\nRemove Micro SD cards and do not re-insert under any circumstances during the update. Switch on Poly/Mojo, making sure Poly is charged and connected to the internet; ensure Poly’s P status LED is a solid colour and not flashing.\nStep 2\nPlease ensure your Poly has installed the previous firmware of 1.0.43 (current firmware version can be viewed under ‘general settings’ in the Gofigure application) If not, please follow the previous steps under ‘preparation’\nStep 3\nUnder ‘device settings’ in Gofigure press “UPDATE FIRMWARE”. You will then be prompted with a message requesting a charger be connected to Poly, please do so and continue. Note: Once you have confirmed the update process, Gofigure will close down. This is NOT a crash, please do not re-open the application and attempt the process again.\nStep 4\nThe Gofigure application has now closed down. Please switch off your Mojo and disconnect the charger from the Mojo/Poly, allowing time for the P.status LED to completely switch off.\nStep 5\nRe-start your Mojo/Poly and connect the charger. The P.status LED will now start flashing blue, green and red for some time. Please leave your Mojo/Poly like this for twenty minutes until the P.status LED has completely switched off. Note: this could take up to twenty minutes.\nStep 6\nThe P.status LED has now switched off, disconnect and then re-connect the charger. The P.status LED will now switch on and remain solid green for approximately twenty seconds as the firmware installs. Note: Please do not attempt to use your Poly in this time\nStep 7\nPoly will now briefly flash, confirming the installation is complete.\nStep 8\nNormal operation, Gofigure can now be used with all additional features.\nNote: from version 1.0.43/2.0.0 onwards, Poly’s firmware update methodology is changing. With subsequent firmware releases, users will now be able to choose when they update their firmware.\n\nHow do I connect to and playback Tidal and Qobuz content using Gofigure?\n\nGofigure does not directly offer the ability to playback content from Tidal or Qobuz, however, if you are unable to use AirPlay or your DLNA/UPnP app does not natively have the ability to stream your music from Tidal or Spotify accounts to Poly, then Gofigure offers a functional alternative. By entering your Tidal or Qobuz login details into Gofigure, you will be able to see content from your streaming service as hierarchical folders within your chosen DLNA/UPnP App. (Note, offline Tidal or Qobuz content cannot currently be accessed by any third-party App). The process below illustrates:\nStep 1:\nOpen Gofigure and connect to your chosen Poly.\n\nStep 2:\nAt the home screen, select the ‘User’ tab from the navigation bar.\n\nStep 3:\nEnter your login information into the text fields provided and select your playback quality. Please note that playback quality is entirely dependent on the quality that you have subscribed to from the streaming service provider. Once you have completed this process your steps within Gofigure are complete.\n\nStep 4:\nDownload a DLNA playback application or open your chosen DLNA app, here we are using 8Player for iOS, but you may use others including Bubble UPnP for Android.\n\nStep 5:\nNo matter what DLNA playback app you use, open the servers tab or view the list of servers and select your Poly device name. You will notice that two of the same device names appear; one as a server and one as a renderer. Select your device name as a renderer.\n\nStep 6:\nIf your login credentials are correct you should now see a list of music services available. Select the music service that you wish to use and browse the folders as you normally would. It may help if you log in to the Tidal or Qobuz apps and arrange your favourite music so its easily discoverable.\nIf you have a search feature within your DLNA app you may use this to search both the Tidal and Qobuz streaming services for content.\n\nI’m hearing interference/buzzing sounds whilst using QuickPlay ?\n\nWe recommend that when using QuickPlay away from a known WiFi signal that you turn on ‘Airplane’ mode through Gofigure. This will stop Poly attempting to scan for a WiFi signal. If you continue to experience difficulties, close the Gofigure app during playback.\n\nI need help using Gofigure, is there a user manual?\n\nIf you need help with navigating the Gofigure app please see the user manual here\n\nI am connected to my home router but cannot see Poly?\n\nPlease first ensure that Poly has a successful connection to a WiFi network, and the one in which you wish to stream via. You can check this via the GoFigure app, via your router settings, and you can see whether Poly is displaying a solid illuminated LED, which indicates a successful connection.\nIf your Poly is in ‘Roon’ mode, it will not be visible as a DLNA/MPD device for SD card playback. Please use ‘Other music services’ for SD card playback.\nIf your Poly is in ‘Airplane/Bluetooth’ mode, it will also not be available as a wifi device.\n\nPoly is not connecting to any WiFi networks?\n\nIf Poly is illuminating a solid colour from its P-status LED then this indicates that Poly is connected to a previously stored network. Please check in the Gofigure application whether this is your desired network. If not- please remove this network from the Wi-Fi settings page by swiping. Please add your desired network and try again.\nIf the P-status LED is flashing blue and then green, this shows the Poly is in ‘Hotspot Mode’. This mode means Poly will broadcast its own Wi-Fi network for you to connect to, rather than connecting to a previously programmed network, or new network. Please dis-engage ‘Hotspot mode’ using the Gofigure app under ‘settings’.\nIf the network that you are attempting to connect to is one that you have previously stored, and successfully streamed from, please ensure that you have not changed the password. If you have not, please try switching this router off and back on again.\n\nI cannot see Poly within my WiFi networks?\n\nThere could be a number of reasons why this has occurred, but it is important to confirm whether Poly’s P-status indicator is flashing blue and green. If it is this indicates that Poly is searching for a WiFi network to connect to. If it is not, and is a solid colour then Poly could have connected to another network, other than that you are searching on.\nIf you have confirmed that this is not the case for the above then you could have entered your Poly into Hotspot mode. Please navigate back to the configuration window to disengage this.\n\nHow do I find out what firmware my Poly is running?\n\nYou can view the version of the current firmware either via manual configuration page (when you use a pin to connect to Poly), or via the Gofigure app.\nIf you are using the Gofigure app, the following navigation path will take you to this: Settings > General Settings > Version\nVia the configuration page, simply scroll to the very bottom of the page and the version will be displayed.\n\nWhat is an SSID?\n\nThe SSID is the name of the Wi-Fi that you connect to. If you are connected to this network already you can usually find the SSID by entering your WiFi settings, or alternatively you can view this by looking at the bottom, or side, of your router so long as you have not changed the network name previously. Whist you are searching for your SSID on your router it may be best to note down the password of the network, please pay careful attention to any special characters and capitalisation.\n\nPoly is not appearing as a Bluetooth device/output?\n\nFirst, it is important to confirm whether your P-status indicator is flashing Purple. If it is please confirm that you are not already connected to this Poly by checking your ‘connected devices’ on your mobile device. Poly may also appear in the ‘other devices’ tab at bottom of the bluetooth search window. Please check this area.\nNote: The P.status flashes purple when connected to a device vie bluetooth and transferring data .\n\nPoly keeps loosing connection when playing from the Micro SD card?\n\nPlease confirm that Poly is successfully set as the output renderer within your app. If this is the case and you are still experiencing difficulties, it may help to restart the playback app or move closer to the router to confirm that the range and processing capabilities of your device are not having an adverse effect.\n\nI’m having an issue with Cover Art?\n\nIssues to do with Cover Art have been addressed within the Poly firmware update 1.0.10.\nIf you continue to experience difficulties with Cover Art please delete the .db file from your inserted Micro SD card and delete the Cover Art folder (if one exists).\nUpon insertion of the SD card into Poly, Poly will now recheck the database and form a new one.\n\nHow do I update Poly, what is the latest Poly firmware version and what improvements have been made?\n\nThe latest Poly firmware version is 2.0.4. You can confirm the firmware version of your Poly by selecting ‘general settings’ in the Gofigure application. Alternatively you can connect to your Polys Hotspot, this will bring up a Poly webpage, your Poly firmware will be listed at the bottom of this webpage.\nPreparation\nPlease make sure your smartphone/device is fully up to date before beginning and you have the latest version of Gofigure.\nEnsure Poly is connected to a wifi connection with internet access. The update is quite large, so it needs a fast and reliable connection in order to download succesfully. Do not use mobile data or a mobile network to download the firmware.\nIn order to install 2.0.0, first your Poly must install a pre-update firmware 1.0.43. To complete this pre-update, leave your Poly connected to a Wi-Fi connection for twenty minutes, then switch off and unplug both Poly and Mojo until the P.status light has gone out. Then re-connect both Mojo and Poly, switching Mojo on. The Poly will have installed version 1.0.43 and is now ready to start the 2.0.0 download process located in the ‘device settings’ section of Gofigure.\nUpdating to 2.0.0 firmware\nStep 1\nRemove Micro SD cards and do not re-insert under any circumstances during the update. Switch on Poly/Mojo, making sure Poly is charged and connected to the internet; ensure Poly’s P status LED is a solid colour and not flashing.\nStep 2\nPlease ensure your Poly has installed the previous firmware of 1.0.43 (current firmware version can be viewed under ‘general settings’ in the Gofigure application) If not, please follow the previous steps under ‘preparation’\nStep 3\nUnder ‘device settings’ in Gofigure press “UPDATE FIRMWARE”. You will then be prompted with a message requesting a charger be connected to Poly, please do so and continue. Note: Once you have confirmed the update process, Gofigure will close down. This is NOT a crash, please do not re-open the application and attempt the process again.\nStep 4\nThe Gofigure application has now closed down. Please switch off your Mojo and disconnect the charger from the Mojo/Poly, allowing time for the P.status LED to completely switch off.\nStep 5\nRe-start your Mojo/Poly and connect the charger. The P.status LED will now start flashing blue, green and red for some time. Please leave your Mojo/Poly like this for twenty minutes until the P.status LED has completely switched off. Note: this could take up to twenty minutes.\nStep 6\nThe P.status LED has now switched off, disconnect and then re-connect the charger. The P.status LED will now switch on and remain solid green for approximately twenty seconds as the firmware installs. Note: Please do not attempt to use your Poly in this time\nStep 7\nPoly will now briefly flash, confirming the installation is complete.\nStep 8\nNormal operation, Gofigure can now be used with all additional features.\nNote: from version 1.0.43/2.0.0 onwards, Poly’s firmware update methodology is changing. With subsequent firmware releases, users will now be able to choose when they update their firmware.\n2.0.4 update includes:\nimproved Roon stability and minor bug fixes\n2.0.3 update includes:\n1.

SD card database management improvements: If the SD card has space for database then the database will be stored on the SD. Therefore, Poly will only index the SD once, if the content has not changed. If there is insufficient space on the SD card, then the database will be created each time Poly is switched on.\n\nPoly is not reading my Micro SD card?\n\nFirst, please make sure that the Micro SD card is fully pushed into the slot. None of the Micro SD card should stand proud of the socket. If this is complete please check that you have formatted your Micro SD card to ExFAT. If this is confirmed and you have already copied music over to the Micro SD card you must make sure that you have left at least 50mb free for a database file to be constructed by Poly’s operating system. This is required for the Micro SD card to be recognised.\n\nPoly will not turn on?\n\nPlease ensure that you have fully charged your Poly before use. A full charge will ensure that you can configure Poly and begin using immediately. If you charge Poly attached to Mojo you must use a charger capable of delivering 2amps of current, any less will not effectively charge both units.\nIf you have performed this, please check that the P-status LED to determine any signs of life. If Poly is functioning this light will illuminate.\n\nPoly takes a long time to turn on, is this normal?\n\nWith some devices, especially when they are cold, the process of Poly turning on can take a short period of time. The process of Poly powering on is reliant on mojo emitting a voltage through its USB, if the diode in Mojo is not hot then it can take longer to power on, which will result in Poly taking longer to power on.\nIf you find yourself regularly waiting more than 25 seconds for the P.status LED to illuminate, please contact support@chordelectronics.co.uk\n\nWhat do Poly’s status lights mean?\n\nPoly uses a series of flashing, or solid, coloured lights to indicate the mode/status.\nA) A flashing blue and green indicates that Poly is in hotspot mode. Poly is now broadcasting its own Wi-Fi network.\nB) Flashing blue following startup or setup indicates that Poly is searching for a stored Wi-Fi network.\nC) Flashing purple during playback indicates that Poly is playing audio via Bluetooth\nD) Solid white indicates that Poly is charging\nE) Solid blue, green, yellow, red, or flashing red indicates the battery life. Blue 75% – 100%, green 50% – 75%, orange 25% – 50%, red 5% – 25%, flashing red 0% – 5%.\nF) Multicoloured rapid flashing indicates that Poly is updating its database of a recently inserted/updated Micro SD card.\nG) repeated red, green and blue flashing means Poly is downloading and attempting to install a firmware update.\n\nDuring charging Poly’s status LED is white and flashing on and off?\n\nThe charger that you are using is providing insufficient current to effectively charge Poly. Please replace with a 2amp charger.\n\nHow do I locate the IP address of Poly?\n\nUsing the Gofigure application, select ‘Wifi’ and then press the small arrow to the right hand side of your current connected network. This will take you to another page displaying a variety of network information.\nAlternatively:\nUsing a pair of headphones, or your Hi-Fi system, connected to Mojo. Press and hold the config button until Poly states ‘current mode’. Then release the config button. Poly will then read a variety of information including Firmware version and current IP address.\n\nI cannot remember how to add a new network to Poly?\n\nAdditional networks can be added in the Gofigure application under settings> Wi-Fi. Previously configured networks will appear at the top of the screen, while any newly available networks will appear below. Please have your Wi-Fi password ready when selecting a new network.\nManual Method:\nTo add a new network Poly must be in access point mode. To do this please insert your config pin into the config hole and press for ten seconds. When you see that Poly’s status flashes blue and green you can now use a device to search for Poly’s unsecured Wi-FI network, please then connect.If the Poly configuration page does not automatically show you must open a browser and input the address poly.audio\nUnder ‘Wifi networks’ you can add both your Poly network name,SSID and Password into the provided boxes (please ensure you name your Poly when adding a new network), then tick ‘SAVE and reboot’. This will re-start your Poly, once it has switched back on it will attempt to connect to any Wi-Fi network within range.\n\nPoly’s status indicator is flashing blue and green and I cannot connect to a Wi-Fi network?\n\nWhen Poly flashes blue and green this indicates that Poly is currently in hotspot mode.

Within the ‘Manage Connections’ tab you will be able to view the stored Wi-Fi networks and remove any you no longer require. Poly will automatically connect to the strongest stored Wi-Fi network.\n\nI want to connect Poly to my smartphone, but I am unable to create a personal hotspot or set up tethering. How can I use Poly?\n\nPoly has a feature named Hotspot mode, which remedies this. Hotspot mode engages Poly’s own internal Wi-Fi router for your smartphone to connect to, similar to how you would connect your smartphone to your Wi-Fi network at home. In this mode, 3G or 4G internet services will be unavailable.\nTo connect please enter access point mode by pressing the supplied pin into the configuration hole for ten seconds. Poly’s status LED will now flash green and blue allowing you to connect to its unsecured Wi-Fi network.\nWithin the network settings, navigate to the Play mode settings and check the box marked ‘Keep in hotspot mode’. Poly will now permanently remain in Hotspot mode until reconfigured. Poly will now be discoverable by your smartphone within the Wi-Fi settings.\nPlease be aware that when in Hotspot mode Poly’s status will flash blue and green.\n\nMy home Wi-Fi network is within range, but I want to connect to my smartphone. How can I do this?\n\nCurrently Poly connects to the strongest Wi-Fi signal that it detects and is unable to prioritise Wi-Fi networks. When the accompanying GoFigure app is released you will be able to select a Wi-Fi network to connect to.\n\nAfter using Hotspot mode, I am unable to connect to another Wi-Fi network?\n\nWhen Hotspot mode has been activated, Poly will remain in this state. This will be indicated by Poly’s status window flashing blue and green. If you wish to connect to a network again, please dis-engage ‘Hotspot Mode’ using the Gofigure application.\nManual:\nTo exit Hotspot mode please press the config button and follow the spoken instructions.\n\nWhen using Hotspot Mode I am unable to access any internet?\n\nWhen in Hotspot mode you are connecting to Poly’s own local Wi-Fi network. As a result, for example, 3G and 4G data services will be unavailable. This will typically be indicated by your phone.\n\nPoly will not disconnect from my Wi-Fi network when on charge?\n\nDuring charging, Poly’s Wi-Fi network remains active so that it can run a fixed system without having to wait to reconnect back to a network when Mojo is switched back on.\n\nAfter streaming via DLNA I am unable to stream via AirPlay?\n\nInside your DLNA application, please un-select Poly as the ‘Audio Output’ and Quit that application.

It offers 49,152 taps. It can be used at home in a conventional audio system or on-the-move using the 7-hour battery life. You get 2 modes of automatic charging with its dedicated Micro USB charging port.\n\nMULTIPLE CONNECTIVITY OPTIONS\n\nYou can connect the Hugo 2 to multiple devices with the optical, coaxial and HD USB inputs. The analogue outputs include RCA connectors, 3.5mm jack and 6.35mm headphone outputs. You can also stream audio wirelessly using Bluetooth with Qualcomm aptX.

And it also comes with a cable and a wall power supply.\n\nAnd a True Multibit™ DAC for $249!\n\nYep, Modi Multibit is the least expensive multibit DAC based on a modern platform—from any manufacturer, anywhere. We’re pretty proud of it. It’s got a whole lot of technology packed into it, from its DSP-based digital filter to the unique-to-audio AD5547 D/A converter. And, it has a 100% linear power supply, 100% standard.\n\nSo, you’re saying you plug these in and you’re ready to go?\n\nPretty much. Both Modis can be used with virtually any computer with no drivers: Windows, Mac, or Linux distros that support UAC 2.0. Some older Windows machines may need a driver, which we provide at schiit.com/drivers. You can also use both Modis with phones and tablets, as well as most Intel Chromebooks.\nModi 3 makes using phones and tablets easier, though, because if you use the provided wall-wart and USB cable into its external power port, it will avoid the dreaded “draws too much power” error.\nModi Multibit may need an external hub or a powered Apple cable to avoid the “draws too much power” error.\n\nWhat’s the difference between Modi 3 and Modi Multibit?\n\nLots. Let’s break it down:\n\nControl: Modi 3 uses a toggle switch to select inputs, Modi Multibit has a pushbutton with LED indication.\n\nD/A Converter: Modi 3 uses the AKM AK4490 DAC, a respected delta-sigma DAC. Modi Multibit uses the AD5547, a unique-to-audio multibit DAC.\n\nDigital Filter: Modi 3 uses the digital filter embedded into the AK4490 DAC, while the Modi Multibit features our own unique closed-form digital filter implemented on an Analog Devices SHARC DSP.\n\nAnalog Section: Modi 3 uses the OPA1662 op-amp and is DC-coupled, Modi Multibit uses the AD8512 and discrete JFET buffers and is DC-coupled with a DC servo.\n\nMiscellaneous: Modi 3 ships with a USB to Micro USB cable and a universal 5V USB wall adapter, Modi Multibit ships only with a 16VAC wall-wart (no cables)\n\nHey, wait, your \"universal\" wall adapter for Modi 3 has a US plug on it. What if I need a Europlug/UK Plug/Australian Plug/Martian/Borg/Uninsulated Victorian/Alternate Timeline Edison DC Plug?\n\nThe wall adapter is universal in the sense that you can plug it into pretty much any common AC wall voltage--100V to 240V--and it will (a) not self-immolate, and (b) provide 5V out of a USB connector. It does have a US/Japan style plug, but you can use a plug adapter and plug it in pretty much anywhere. Or you can use any 5V-out USB wall adapter you have handy. Or a battery pack. Or a computer.\n\nWow, so what’s the catch with Modi 3? It seems too good to be true.\n\nThe catch is you don’t get the fancy button and LEDs of the Modi Multibit. You also don’t get the DSP-based digital filter, or the AD5547 DAC. You also lose the linear power supply for a switcher.\n\nI thought you hated switching power supplies!\n\nWe’ve said we would never use one where we didn’t need to. In this case, to hit the performance and price we were looking for, it needed a switcher. Don’t worry. It’s a very nice switcher.\n\nWell, I’m gonna get me a fancy-shmantzy linear power supply and plug it into the back your Modi 3, what do you think about that?\n\nWe think you’re a little strange, because the output of that fancy power supply is going into a switcher, anyway. But if it makes you happy, we’re not going to stop you. Nor will we try to sell you such a power supply.\n\nWell, let’s change the subject to Modi Multibit. It looks like it doesn’t measure as well as Modi 3, is that right?\n\nRight. If you’re looking at standard performance metrics for steady-state signals, delta-sigma DACs will measure better than Multibit. If you’re looking for measurements, Modi 3 is your DAC.\n\nBut you think the Modi Multibit sounds better?\n\nYes.\n\nYou guys are a little touched in the head, aren’t you?\n\nQuite possibly.\n\nBut I don’t get why you’d want to have a worse-measuring product—\n\nLet us cut you off right there, because we know how this argument goes. And goes. And goes. And keeps on going. Here’s the deal: we are free to believe what we want. So are you. If your belief system leads you to devices that perform well by standard metrics, cool. If not, that’s also cool. There’s room for both viewpoints. Look up “Schiit Happened, The Objectivist/Subjectivist Synthesis.” And even then you may think we’re entirely full of it. And that’s cool.\n\nSo what platforms does your USB input support?\n\nActually, the question should be “What platforms support your USB input?” since our USB input is 100% UAC2 compliant (that is, USB Audio Class 2, the accepted standard for USB audio transmission.) So, here you go:\n\nWindows. Windows 10 is highly recommended. It is usually plug and play with our DACs. Windows 7 and 8 will work, but may need our drivers. Windows XP, Vista, and Windows Server editions are all untested and are not recommended.\n\nMac OSX. From 10.7 on up, Macs have been plug and play with our DACs.\n\niOS. From iOS7 on up, iOS devices work with our DACs using a USB Camera Connection Kit, Lightning to USB Camera Adapter, or Lightning to USB3 Camera Adapter.\n\nAndroid. Most Android devices that shipped with Android M or above work with our DACs using a USB OTG cable. Some may require separate player software, like USB Audio Player Pro.\n\nLinux. Most Linux distros that support UAC2 natively will be plug and play with our DACs. Please note that we cannot provide detailed technical support for Linux.\n\nI want a combined DAC/amp! Why didn’t you put an amp in here?\n\nWe did. They’re just in different chassis and costs another $99-149. They’re called “Magni 3” and “Vali 2.” The latter of which even gives you a tube! Now you have options, instead of a single boring, soon-to-be-obsolete combo box.\n\nIf Modis are so great, why would I step up to Bifrost or Gungnir or Yggdrasil?\n\nBecause you want something big enough to hold down the curling veneer on the fake-bark stereo rack you got on sale at K-Mart in 1979. Or because you want even higher performance. Or upgradability. Modis aren’t upgradable.\n\nBut I heard from a dude on the intarwebs all DACs sound the same! You’re bullshitting us\n\nIf it’s your experience that all DACs sound the same, that’s cool. There’s a DAC in your iPhone or Android phone, so you can use that one and save even more cash.\n\nWarranty\n\n2 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Schiit Modi 2 Multibit comes with a 2 year warranty from Schiit that covers manufacturing defects.

These products give you the same satisfaction of new products - but at down-to-earth prices. Usually, the product's packaging may have gotten damaged in transit. Customers use a product once or twice and then return it with opened up packaging.\n\nWHERE DO UNBOXED PRODUCTS COME FROM?\n\nCustomer Returns Returned headphones are fully functional products that have left the warehouse and therefore can no longer be sold as new as their packaging has been opened. The product may have been used once or twice by the customer who returned it.\n\nTransit Damages Sometimes we receive headphones in damaged packaging due to shipping accidents. These are brand new headphones with cosmetic flaws on the packaging.\n\nWhy Buy Unboxed Headphones?\n\nSave Upto 15%\nSince you won't get the original packaging, we give you a good discount compared to a new headphone.\n\nProfessionally Inspected\nA thorough inspection means you receive a 100% working headphone with no sound output issues.\n\nOriginal Warranty\nAll unboxed headphones carry the same warranty period as a brand new headphone would.\n\nUnbiased Customer Service\nWe have the same Headphone Zone customer support experience for Unboxed Products or new products.\n\nUnchanged Replacement Policy\nReceived a defective Unboxed unit?

This is done with its 50mm dual-diaphragm drivers and superior materials. With this headphone, you can experience pure audio without the artificial processing of battery-powered headsets. To ensure that these are ready for use and can consistently hit all notes, the Crossfade LP2 is tested at 6 different frequencies.\n\nFLEXIBLE. STURDY. RUGGED.\n\nBe it a range of temperatures, salt spray, humidity or UV exposure, the Crossfade LP2 will never let you down. It is built with a steel frame and interchangeable aircraft-grade metal shields. The SteelFlex headband is so flexible, it can bend flat more than 10 times while the cable can bend over a million times. The V-MODA Crossfade LP2 is tested according to Military-Level Quality MIL-STD-810G Test Standards. You can also carry your Crossfade LP2 safely wherever you'd like. Just slip it in the Exoskeleton case & you're good to go.\n\nERGONOMIC FIT FOR MAXIMUM ISOLATION AND MINIMUM SOUND LEAK\n\nMore than 4 years of R&D have resulted in the ergonomic headband and hexagon-shaped earcups that does away with fatigue. The BLISS foam ear cushions take the shape of your ears for added comfort and noise isolation. Analogue sound isolation cuts out all outside noise while letting you enjoy your music without worrying about (a lot of) sound leakage.\n\nTRUSTED BY MORE THAN 200 DJS, GRAMMY-WINNING MUSICIANS, AUDIOPHILES AND ARTISTS\n\nV-MODA headphones are known for their blend of good looks that do not compromise on functionality.

We like to think of the progression like this: Black is beautiful, Red is more beautiful, and Cobalt is most beautiful. For a complete Model Comparison Chart, Click here.\n\nWill DragonFly make my internal computer speakers sound better?\n\nNo. DragonFly does not use the internal speakers in your computer. DragonFly is specifically designed to connect to external audio devices, such as headphones, powered desktop speakers, complete audio/video systems, and iOS and Android mobile devices. Note: DragonFly v1.0 and DragonFly v1.2 are designed to work with computers and laptops only; they are not designed for use with iOS and Android mobile devices. However, all current-production DragonFly models—Black, Red, and Cobalt—are compatible with iOS and Android devices.\n\nWhat kind of audio content can I play through DragonFly?\n\nFrom MP3 to MQA and Hi-Res, DragonFly adds life, meaning, and color to all of your music. With all current-production models of AudioQuest’s DragonFly USB DAC (Black, Red, Cobalt), music appreciation and exploration are limitless: Plug into an Apple or Windows® computer or connect to an iOS® or Android mobile device. Play YouTube or Vimeo videos. Go hunting on Bandcamp or SoundCloud. Explore playlists and podcasts on Spotify, Pandora, or Deezer. Stream high-res audio from Tidal or Qobuz. No matter the choice of sonic pleasure, DragonFly unravels the emotional expression and nuance that makes music and movies so enjoyable.\n\nWhat headphones can I use with the DragonFly?\n\nDragonFly is versatile enough to drive virtually any headphone on the market today, from impedances of 10ohm and higher. While all DragonFly models offer enough output to drive most headphones, DragonFly Black (1.2-volt output) comfortably drives most medium- to moderate-efficiency models and DragonFlys Red and Cobalt (2.1-volt output) easily drive even the lowest-efficiency models.\n\nWhat is an MQA Renderer?\n\nand also matches and compensates the DAC characteristics to the hierarchical target, matching the analog sound heard in the studio. All current-production AudioQuest DragonFlys (Black, Red, and Cobalt) feature an MQA renderer that enables playback of MQA audio files and streams, delivering the sound of the original master recording. When connected to an MQA Core signal (within TIDAL Masters or Audirvana, for example), DragonFly’s purple display indicates the unit is rendering an MQA stream or file.\n\nHow do I play MQA files from Tidal on my Apple device?\n\nAs a fully functional MQA renderer, your DragonFly is ready to unfold and play MQA files through the Tidal music-streaming service. If you have a Tidal Master account and want to enjoy the full benefits of Tidal Master (MQA) files through DragonFly, simply adjust your Tidal playback settings: macOS\nClick on your profile name (located in the top left corner of the Tidal desktop application)\nChoose “Settings”\nSelect “Streaming”\nUnder “Streaming Audio Quality,” select “Master”\nMake sure that your DragonFly is selected for Sound Output\nBeside “Sound Output,” click “More settings”\nSelect “Use Exclusive Mode”\nMake sure that “Passthrough MQA” is not selected\niOS, iPhone, iPad, iPad Pro\nClick “My Collection” (the heart icon; located in the bottom right of the mobile app)\nClick the gear wheel (located in the upper right)\nScroll down and click “Streaming”\nSet WiFi to “Master”\nSet Cellular to your desired option, noting that streaming hi-res with MQA will require a relatively large amount of data\nMake sure “Optimized playback” is enabled\nStart at a very low volume and gradually work your way up to a comfortable level\n\nHow do I play MQA files from Tidal on my Windows computer?\n\nTo play MQA files from Tidal on a Windows computer, follow these steps in the Tidal app:\nClick on your profile name\nChoose “Settings”\nSelect “Streaming”\nMake sure that your DragonFly is selected for Sound Output\nBeside “Sound Output,” click “More settings”\nSelect “Use Exclusive Mode”\nStart at a very low volume and gradually work your way up to a comfortable level\n\nHow do I play MQA files from Tidal on my Android device?\n\nFor Android playback, we recommend the USB Audio Player Pro media player by eXtream Software Development.\n\nCan I use DragonFly with Windows operating systems?\n\nYes. DragonFly is compatible with Windows 7 and later. If you’re running the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, please be sure to install the Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 (August 9, 2016), to maintain optimal USB audio performance.\n\nWhy can’t I select 88.2kHz as the sample rate in Windows 7?\n\nMicrosoft does not offer native support for 88.2kHz with its Windows 7 operating system. Fortunately, aftermarket programs such as JRiver Media Center and Foobar2000 bypass the Windows “Hardware and Sound” application and allow native 88.2kHz decoding. For more information please visit www.jriver.com or www.foobar2000.org.\n\nAre there known USB-Audio issues with Windows 8 and Windows RT?\n\nEarly versions of Windows 8 had compatibility issues with their device drivers and many USB DACs (including DragonFly). If you are running Windows 8, we suggest that you do the following:\nMake sure your OS has all of the latest updates and service packs installed.\nOnce all OS updates have been installed, check that all hardware device drivers are up to date and compatible with the latest version of Windows 8.\n\nThere are no reported audio issues with Windows 8.1.\n\nThe AQ Device Manager is not detecting my DragonFly. What should I do?\n\nIf the installation is complete and the DragonFly is not visible, you may need to restart your computer to complete the installation process.\n\nCan I use DragonFly with Mac OS X?\n\nYes. DragonFly Black, Red, and Cobalt are compatible with OS X (starting with OS 10.6.8 to present). There are no known compatibility issues with OS X.\n\nCan I use DragonFly with Apple iOS devices?\n\nYes. DragonFly Black and Red can be used with Apple iOS devices. Yes. DragonFly Black, Red, and Cobalt can be used with Apple iOS devices. An Apple Camera Adapter is required to connect DragonFly to an Apple Lightning device. In our tests, Apple's Lightning-to-USB 3 Camera Adapter (with charging port) sounds better and is more reliable than Apple’s less expensive Lightning-to-USB Camera Adapter, while also providing the ability to charge during playback. Your mileage may vary. Some users prefer the size of the smaller adapter, while others prefer the performance of the larger adapter. We encourage experimentation. When DragonFly (Black, Red, Cobalt) is connected to an iOS device using Apple’s older Lightning to USB Camera Connection Kit, I can hear clicks and pops in the background of the music. What should I do? In some rare instances, the combination of an iOS device in conjunction with the standard CCK and DragonFly Black, Red, or Cobalt causes a clicking in the background of the music. Neither we nor Apple have been able to determine why this is, but, in circumstances where this occurs, we’ve found that using Apple’s Lightning-to-USB 3 Camera Adapter resolves the problem. In addition, this connector offers improved audio performance over the smaller unit and provides the ability to charge the attached iOS device while listening to music.\n\nCan I use DragonFly with Android devices?\n\nYes. DragonFly Black, Red, and Cobalt will work with most Android devices running on Lollipop OS (and some Android devices running on KitKat), provided that the device manufacturer has adhered to the USB specification and implementation, and supports audio over USB. To verify that your Android device complies with isochronous USB audio, download and run USB Host Check. In our early pre-production testing, we found that some Android devices (4.1 OS and newer) do not provide native support for audio over USB. If you find that your Android device (4.1 or newer) does not support audio over USB, we ask that you please contact the manufacturer of your device. To determine whether your device supports audio over USB, consult the user manual or visit the manufacturer’s website. Despite Android’s support of USB audio output, there are still hardware manufacturers that do not completely adhere to the USB audio class specification. If you experience this, we recommend the USB Audio Player Pro application. UAPP includes its own USB audio device driver that is compliant with the USB Organization’s USB Audio Host Mode Class specification. Further, it is compatible with various audio formats and will manage music on both the Android’s internal memory and inserted SD cards. With the phone connected to the Wi-Fi network, this application can also find and connect to DLNA servers/libraries. USB Audio Player PRO Version 5 now supports audio from Google Music, Tidal (including Tidal Masters), Qobuz, and Shoutcast, and includes an MQA Core Decoder, which will unfold MQA streams from 44.1/48kHz to 88.2/96 kHz and can be combined with DragonFly for further unfolding of even higher sample rates.\n\nHow do I set volume level when using DragonFly?\n\nWhen using DragonFly with headphones, powered speakers, or a power amplifier, start at a low (or zero) volume level, then slowly raise the volume until the desired level is achieved. When using DragonFly with headphones, powered speakers, or a power amplifier, it functions in variable output mode, and we recommend the following steps:\nSet the volume control of the associated music player application to maximum.\nSet the computer’s main (operating system) volume control to 25% of maximum.\nUsing the computer’s main (operating system) volume control, adjust the volume to the desired level.\n\nDragonFly Black is equipped with a 64-step analog volume control. With DragonFly Black connected to a PC or mobile device, adjusting the host’s system volume control will, through proxy, control the DragonFly Black’s onboard volume. This ensures maximum resolution and the highest sound quality, regardless of volume setting.\n\nIn DragonFly Red and Cobalt, we were able to employ a highly sophisticated 64-step, 64-bit, bit-perfect digital volume control. It works similarly: With DragonFly Red/Cobalt connected to a PC or mobile device, adjusting the host’s system volume control will, through proxy, control the DragonFly’s onboard volume. Here again, we’ve optimized the volume control to ensure maximum resolution and the highest sound quality, regardless of volume setting.\n\nYou can also use DragonFly as a traditional fixed-output source component (such as a CD player, DVD player, or Blu-ray player), connected to a standard input on a receiver or preamplifier. When used in this manner, DragonFly functions in fixed output mode, which allows the overall volume level to be adjusted with the audio/video system’s master volume control. For this application, both the music player’s volume control and the computer’s main (operating system) volume level should be set to maximum.\n\nDragonFly can play audio data at four different sample rates. Which one should I choose?\n\nDragonFly will play music or audio data at sample rates of 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88.2kHz, or 96kHz. For the best sound quality, the computer should be configured so that it sends music and audio data to DragonFly that matches the native rate of the music. For example, since all CDs use a sample rate of 44.1kHz, 44.1kHz tends to be the “native rate” of most digital music. In most cases, for most people, this will be the best sample rate to choose. Choosing a sample rate that is higher than the native rate of a music file will convert the audio data using mathematical approximations that can potentially decrease the sound quality. Conversely, if you have high-resolution music files, configuring your computer for 44.1kHz (or any other lower sample rate) will cause the computer to down-sample your music to a lower resolution. When possible, always configure the computer to output the native sample rate of the music you are listening to. Many music player software suites on the market manage this process for you.\n\nWhat do the various colors of DragonFly’s LED indicate?\n\nDragonFly’s LED displays different colors to indicate status or sample rate of audio data. For DragonFlys Black and Red: Red = Standby; Green = 44.1kHz; Blue = 48kHz; Amber = 88.2kHz; Magenta = 96kHz; Purple = MQA. For DragonFly Cobalt: Red = Standby; Green = 44.1kHz; Blue = 48kHz; Yellow = 88.2kHz; Light Blue = 96kHz; Purple = MQA.\n\nI purchased high-resolution music files at 24-bit/176.4kHz or 24-bit/192kHz. Can I play these files using my DragonFly? Yes. However, as mentioned above, DragonFly performs best when audio data is processed at its native sample rate.\n\nIf you have higher resolution files, it is important to choose the correct higher sample rate in order to maximize the benefit of those files. For the best performance with sampling rates above DragonFly’s 96kHz ceiling, files should be played at a rate mathematically related to their native resolution. For instance, a 192kHz file should be played at 96kHz (i.e., 2 x 96000.0 = 192000.0). By selecting sample rates that are directly divisible, the computer avoids having to do sonically degrading, complex math in its conversions, and allows DragonFly to sound its best.\n\nWhat music player applications does AudioQuest recommend?\n\nWhile iTunes was once the easy and obvious answer, a cottage industry of higher-performance, add-on applications have since sprouted up. These applications address OS X only.\nAmarra\nAudirvana Plus\nBit Perfect\nPure Music\n\nStand-alone media players (for Apple and Windows)\n\nJRiver is a complete audio and video media player, offering both USB and Network (airplay and DLNA) connectivity.\nRoon works seamlessly with a local media collection and Tidal Streaming services. Additionally, Roon enables streaming to multiple locations, and a complementary iPad application enables an external interface.\nTidal is a subscription-based, CD-quality (1411kbps) streaming service. It offers both music and high-definition video content, including full-length concerts\nQobuz is a subscription-based streaming service that offers an outstanding selection of hi-resolution content.\n\nFor any technical support or questions regarding the functionality or use of these recommended playback applications, please contact the manufacturer. AudioQuest cannot provide technical support for any of these recommended playback applications.\n\nIs DragonFly a FCC-compliant digital device?\n\nDragonFly has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a Class B digital device, pursuant to Part 15 of the FCC Rules. These limits are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful interference in a residential installation. This equipment generates, uses, and can radiate radio frequency energy, and, if not installed and used in accordance with the instructions, may cause harmful interference to radio communications. However, there is no guarantee that interference will not occur in a particular installation. If this equipment does cause harmful interference to radio or television reception, which can be determined by turning the equipment off and on, the user is encouraged to try to correct the interference by one or more of the following measures:\nReorient or relocate the receiving antenna.\nIncrease the separation between the equipment and receiver.\nConnect the equipment to an outlet on a circuit different from that of the receiver.\nConsult the dealer or an experienced radio/TV technician.\n\nModifications not expressly approved by the manufacturer could void the user’s authority to operate the equipment under FCC rules.\n\nIs it better to leave DragonFly constantly plugged in, or should I unplug it when it’s not in use?\n\nIt is completely safe to leave DragonFly plugged in at all times. We hope that you will always want it connected to your music playback device! While repeatedly plugging and unplugging DragonFly will not affect its lifespan or reliability, in general we have found that DACs measure and sound better after being left on for at least 24 hours.\n\nDo you recommend using JitterBug with DragonFly?\n\nWe absolutely recommend using JitterBug with DragonFlys Black and Red, both in series (with DragonFly plugged directly into JitterBug) and/or in parallel (with JitterBug plugged into a separate USB port within the host computer). However, because some of JitterBug’s filtering is included in DragonFly Cobalt, a JitterBug is not necessary and not recommended with mobile devices or when only one USB port is available. When using Cobalt, you can still optimize the digital audio from a computer, car stereo, or other hardware by adding a JitterBug (in parallel only) into a different USB port.\n\nBuying Guide\n\nBest Amp/DACs for your Headphones for Beginner Audiophiles\nby Shanth Swaroop May 09, 2020\nThere are many kinds of DACs available at different price points.

We like to think of the progression like this: Black is beautiful, Red is more beautiful, and Cobalt is most beautiful. For a complete Model Comparison Chart, Click here.\n\nWill DragonFly make my internal computer speakers sound better?\n\nNo. DragonFly does not use the internal speakers in your computer. DragonFly is specifically designed to connect to external audio devices, such as headphones, powered desktop speakers, complete audio/video systems, and iOS and Android mobile devices. Note: DragonFly v1.0 and DragonFly v1.2 are designed to work with computers and laptops only; they are not designed for use with iOS and Android mobile devices. However, all current-production DragonFly models—Black, Red, and Cobalt—are compatible with iOS and Android devices.\n\nWhat kind of audio content can I play through DragonFly?\n\nFrom MP3 to MQA and Hi-Res, DragonFly adds life, meaning, and color to all of your music. With all current-production models of AudioQuest’s DragonFly USB DAC (Black, Red, Cobalt), music appreciation and exploration are limitless: Plug into an Apple or Windows® computer or connect to an iOS® or Android mobile device. Play YouTube or Vimeo videos. Go hunting on Bandcamp or SoundCloud. Explore playlists and podcasts on Spotify, Pandora, or Deezer. Stream high-res audio from Tidal or Qobuz. No matter the choice of sonic pleasure, DragonFly unravels the emotional expression and nuance that makes music and movies so enjoyable.\n\nWhat headphones can I use with the DragonFly?\n\nDragonFly is versatile enough to drive virtually any headphone on the market today, from impedances of 10ohm and higher. While all DragonFly models offer enough output to drive most headphones, DragonFly Black (1.2-volt output) comfortably drives most medium- to moderate-efficiency models and DragonFlys Red and Cobalt (2.1-volt output) easily drive even the lowest-efficiency models.\n\nWhat is an MQA Renderer?\n\nand also matches and compensates the DAC characteristics to the hierarchical target, matching the analog sound heard in the studio. All current-production AudioQuest DragonFlys (Black, Red, and Cobalt) feature an MQA renderer that enables playback of MQA audio files and streams, delivering the sound of the original master recording. When connected to an MQA Core signal (within TIDAL Masters or Audirvana, for example), DragonFly’s purple display indicates the unit is rendering an MQA stream or file.\n\nHow do I play MQA files from Tidal on my Apple device?\n\nAs a fully functional MQA renderer, your DragonFly is ready to unfold and play MQA files through the Tidal music-streaming service. If you have a Tidal Master account and want to enjoy the full benefits of Tidal Master (MQA) files through DragonFly, simply adjust your Tidal playback settings: macOS\nClick on your profile name (located in the top left corner of the Tidal desktop application)\nChoose “Settings”\nSelect “Streaming”\nUnder “Streaming Audio Quality,” select “Master”\nMake sure that your DragonFly is selected for Sound Output\nBeside “Sound Output,” click “More settings”\nSelect “Use Exclusive Mode”\nMake sure that “Passthrough MQA” is not selected\niOS, iPhone, iPad, iPad Pro\nClick “My Collection” (the heart icon; located in the bottom right of the mobile app)\nClick the gear wheel (located in the upper right)\nScroll down and click “Streaming”\nSet WiFi to “Master”\nSet Cellular to your desired option, noting that streaming hi-res with MQA will require a relatively large amount of data\nMake sure “Optimized playback” is enabled\nStart at a very low volume and gradually work your way up to a comfortable level\n\nHow do I play MQA files from Tidal on my Windows computer?\n\nTo play MQA files from Tidal on a Windows computer, follow these steps in the Tidal app:\nClick on your profile name\nChoose “Settings”\nSelect “Streaming”\nMake sure that your DragonFly is selected for Sound Output\nBeside “Sound Output,” click “More settings”\nSelect “Use Exclusive Mode”\nStart at a very low volume and gradually work your way up to a comfortable level\n\nHow do I play MQA files from Tidal on my Android device?\n\nFor Android playback, we recommend the USB Audio Player Pro media player by eXtream Software Development.\n\nCan I use DragonFly with Windows operating systems?\n\nYes. DragonFly is compatible with Windows 7 and later. If you’re running the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, please be sure to install the Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 (August 9, 2016), to maintain optimal USB audio performance.\n\nWhy can’t I select 88.2kHz as the sample rate in Windows 7?\n\nMicrosoft does not offer native support for 88.2kHz with its Windows 7 operating system. Fortunately, aftermarket programs such as JRiver Media Center and Foobar2000 bypass the Windows “Hardware and Sound” application and allow native 88.2kHz decoding. For more information please visit www.jriver.com or www.foobar2000.org.\n\nAre there known USB-Audio issues with Windows 8 and Windows RT?\n\nEarly versions of Windows 8 had compatibility issues with their device drivers and many USB DACs (including DragonFly). If you are running Windows 8, we suggest that you do the following:\nMake sure your OS has all of the latest updates and service packs installed.\nOnce all OS updates have been installed, check that all hardware device drivers are up to date and compatible with the latest version of Windows 8.\n\nThere are no reported audio issues with Windows 8.1.\n\nThe AQ Device Manager is not detecting my DragonFly. What should I do?\n\nIf the installation is complete and the DragonFly is not visible, you may need to restart your computer to complete the installation process.\n\nCan I use DragonFly with Mac OS X?\n\nYes. DragonFly Black, Red, and Cobalt are compatible with OS X (starting with OS 10.6.8 to present). There are no known compatibility issues with OS X.\n\nCan I use DragonFly with Apple iOS devices?\n\nYes. DragonFly Black and Red can be used with Apple iOS devices. Yes. DragonFly Black, Red, and Cobalt can be used with Apple iOS devices. An Apple Camera Adapter is required to connect DragonFly to an Apple Lightning device. In our tests, Apple's Lightning-to-USB 3 Camera Adapter (with charging port) sounds better and is more reliable than Apple’s less expensive Lightning-to-USB Camera Adapter, while also providing the ability to charge during playback. Your mileage may vary. Some users prefer the size of the smaller adapter, while others prefer the performance of the larger adapter. We encourage experimentation. When DragonFly (Black, Red, Cobalt) is connected to an iOS device using Apple’s older Lightning to USB Camera Connection Kit, I can hear clicks and pops in the background of the music. What should I do? In some rare instances, the combination of an iOS device in conjunction with the standard CCK and DragonFly Black, Red, or Cobalt causes a clicking in the background of the music. Neither we nor Apple have been able to determine why this is, but, in circumstances where this occurs, we’ve found that using Apple’s Lightning-to-USB 3 Camera Adapter resolves the problem. In addition, this connector offers improved audio performance over the smaller unit and provides the ability to charge the attached iOS device while listening to music.\n\nCan I use DragonFly with Android devices?\n\nYes. DragonFly Black, Red, and Cobalt will work with most Android devices running on Lollipop OS (and some Android devices running on KitKat), provided that the device manufacturer has adhered to the USB specification and implementation, and supports audio over USB. To verify that your Android device complies with isochronous USB audio, download and run USB Host Check. In our early pre-production testing, we found that some Android devices (4.1 OS and newer) do not provide native support for audio over USB. If you find that your Android device (4.1 or newer) does not support audio over USB, we ask that you please contact the manufacturer of your device. To determine whether your device supports audio over USB, consult the user manual or visit the manufacturer’s website. Despite Android’s support of USB audio output, there are still hardware manufacturers that do not completely adhere to the USB audio class specification. If you experience this, we recommend the USB Audio Player Pro application. UAPP includes its own USB audio device driver that is compliant with the USB Organization’s USB Audio Host Mode Class specification. Further, it is compatible with various audio formats and will manage music on both the Android’s internal memory and inserted SD cards. With the phone connected to the Wi-Fi network, this application can also find and connect to DLNA servers/libraries. USB Audio Player PRO Version 5 now supports audio from Google Music, Tidal (including Tidal Masters), Qobuz, and Shoutcast, and includes an MQA Core Decoder, which will unfold MQA streams from 44.1/48kHz to 88.2/96 kHz and can be combined with DragonFly for further unfolding of even higher sample rates.\n\nHow do I set volume level when using DragonFly?\n\nWhen using DragonFly with headphones, powered speakers, or a power amplifier, start at a low (or zero) volume level, then slowly raise the volume until the desired level is achieved. When using DragonFly with headphones, powered speakers, or a power amplifier, it functions in variable output mode, and we recommend the following steps:\nSet the volume control of the associated music player application to maximum.\nSet the computer’s main (operating system) volume control to 25% of maximum.\nUsing the computer’s main (operating system) volume control, adjust the volume to the desired level.\n\nDragonFly Black is equipped with a 64-step analog volume control. With DragonFly Black connected to a PC or mobile device, adjusting the host’s system volume control will, through proxy, control the DragonFly Black’s onboard volume. This ensures maximum resolution and the highest sound quality, regardless of volume setting.\n\nIn DragonFly Red and Cobalt, we were able to employ a highly sophisticated 64-step, 64-bit, bit-perfect digital volume control. It works similarly: With DragonFly Red/Cobalt connected to a PC or mobile device, adjusting the host’s system volume control will, through proxy, control the DragonFly’s onboard volume. Here again, we’ve optimized the volume control to ensure maximum resolution and the highest sound quality, regardless of volume setting.\n\nYou can also use DragonFly as a traditional fixed-output source component (such as a CD player, DVD player, or Blu-ray player), connected to a standard input on a receiver or preamplifier. When used in this manner, DragonFly functions in fixed output mode, which allows the overall volume level to be adjusted with the audio/video system’s master volume control. For this application, both the music player’s volume control and the computer’s main (operating system) volume level should be set to maximum.\n\nDragonFly can play audio data at four different sample rates. Which one should I choose?\n\nDragonFly will play music or audio data at sample rates of 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88.2kHz, or 96kHz. For the best sound quality, the computer should be configured so that it sends music and audio data to DragonFly that matches the native rate of the music. For example, since all CDs use a sample rate of 44.1kHz, 44.1kHz tends to be the “native rate” of most digital music. In most cases, for most people, this will be the best sample rate to choose. Choosing a sample rate that is higher than the native rate of a music file will convert the audio data using mathematical approximations that can potentially decrease the sound quality. Conversely, if you have high-resolution music files, configuring your computer for 44.1kHz (or any other lower sample rate) will cause the computer to down-sample your music to a lower resolution. When possible, always configure the computer to output the native sample rate of the music you are listening to. Many music player software suites on the market manage this process for you.\n\nWhat do the various colors of DragonFly’s LED indicate?\n\nDragonFly’s LED displays different colors to indicate status or sample rate of audio data. For DragonFlys Black and Red: Red = Standby; Green = 44.1kHz; Blue = 48kHz; Amber = 88.2kHz; Magenta = 96kHz; Purple = MQA. For DragonFly Cobalt: Red = Standby; Green = 44.1kHz; Blue = 48kHz; Yellow = 88.2kHz; Light Blue = 96kHz; Purple = MQA.\n\nI purchased high-resolution music files at 24-bit/176.4kHz or 24-bit/192kHz. Can I play these files using my DragonFly? Yes. However, as mentioned above, DragonFly performs best when audio data is processed at its native sample rate.\n\nIf you have higher resolution files, it is important to choose the correct higher sample rate in order to maximize the benefit of those files. For the best performance with sampling rates above DragonFly’s 96kHz ceiling, files should be played at a rate mathematically related to their native resolution. For instance, a 192kHz file should be played at 96kHz (i.e., 2 x 96000.0 = 192000.0). By selecting sample rates that are directly divisible, the computer avoids having to do sonically degrading, complex math in its conversions, and allows DragonFly to sound its best.\n\nWhat music player applications does AudioQuest recommend?\n\nWhile iTunes was once the easy and obvious answer, a cottage industry of higher-performance, add-on applications have since sprouted up. These applications address OS X only.\nAmarra\nAudirvana Plus\nBit Perfect\nPure Music\n\nStand-alone media players (for Apple and Windows)\n\nJRiver is a complete audio and video media player, offering both USB and Network (airplay and DLNA) connectivity.\nRoon works seamlessly with a local media collection and Tidal Streaming services. Additionally, Roon enables streaming to multiple locations, and a complementary iPad application enables an external interface.\nTidal is a subscription-based, CD-quality (1411kbps) streaming service. It offers both music and high-definition video content, including full-length concerts\nQobuz is a subscription-based streaming service that offers an outstanding selection of hi-resolution content.\n\nFor any technical support or questions regarding the functionality or use of these recommended playback applications, please contact the manufacturer. AudioQuest cannot provide technical support for any of these recommended playback applications.\n\nIs DragonFly a FCC-compliant digital device?\n\nDragonFly has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a Class B digital device, pursuant to Part 15 of the FCC Rules. These limits are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful interference in a residential installation. This equipment generates, uses, and can radiate radio frequency energy, and, if not installed and used in accordance with the instructions, may cause harmful interference to radio communications. However, there is no guarantee that interference will not occur in a particular installation. If this equipment does cause harmful interference to radio or television reception, which can be determined by turning the equipment off and on, the user is encouraged to try to correct the interference by one or more of the following measures:\nReorient or relocate the receiving antenna.\nIncrease the separation between the equipment and receiver.\nConnect the equipment to an outlet on a circuit different from that of the receiver.\nConsult the dealer or an experienced radio/TV technician.\n\nModifications not expressly approved by the manufacturer could void the user’s authority to operate the equipment under FCC rules.\n\nIs it better to leave DragonFly constantly plugged in, or should I unplug it when it’s not in use?\n\nIt is completely safe to leave DragonFly plugged in at all times. We hope that you will always want it connected to your music playback device! While repeatedly plugging and unplugging DragonFly will not affect its lifespan or reliability, in general we have found that DACs measure and sound better after being left on for at least 24 hours.\n\nDo you recommend using JitterBug with DragonFly?\n\nWe absolutely recommend using JitterBug with DragonFlys Black and Red, both in series (with DragonFly plugged directly into JitterBug) and/or in parallel (with JitterBug plugged into a separate USB port within the host computer). However, because some of JitterBug’s filtering is included in DragonFly Cobalt, a JitterBug is not necessary and not recommended with mobile devices or when only one USB port is available. When using Cobalt, you can still optimize the digital audio from a computer, car stereo, or other hardware by adding a JitterBug (in parallel only) into a different USB port.\n\nDOWNLOADS\nFlight Manual DragonFly Black\nWarranty & Media Reviews\n\n1 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this AudioQuest DragonFly Black comes with a 1 year warranty from AudioQuest that covers manufacturing defects.

    "description": "Designed & Made in the USA\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nConnect With USB\n\nMetal Build\n\nDESCRIPTION\nSchiit’s Wyrd is a single port USB hub with a low noise power supply. Why do you need it? If you’ve ever heard a strange noise from your USB DAC or heard it “drop off” after the computer goes to sleep, or you simply have trouble recognizing your DAC at all, it could be due to noisy USB power or USB port power management. The Schiit WYRD has you covered.\nThe Wyrd is the first device to combine both a low-noise, linear power supply, and USB hub chip with a precision crystal oscillator. This adaptor features “ precision low-noise (2.5uV) voltage regulators ”. Thus it is to lower the noise reaching the DAC over the Vbus, not by substitution and not filtration. The Wyrd enables you to use it with any USB DAC—2.0, 1.0, 32/384, DSD1024. It efficiently cleans up the USB connection, and it supports all USB Audio Standards.\nWyrd is the only USB decrapifier that includes a linear power supply and precision 2.5uV LM723 regulators with discrete pass elements for up to 200,000x less noise than what comes out of your USB port, up to 500mA—the full USB 2.0 spec.\nThe vast majority of the total production cost of Wyrd—chassis, boards, assembly, etc goes to the USA manufacturing companies. The brand truly means it when they say ‘Made in the USA’. The Wyrd comes with a 2-year warranty, something that speaks for its quality.\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n2 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Schiit Wyrd comes with a 2 year warranty from Schiit that covers manufacturing defects. All products featured on Headphone Zone are backed by an original manufacturer's warranty. Read more about Schiit's warranty in India.",

    "description": "Designed in Germany\n\nBalanced Sound Signature\n\n2 Years of Warranty\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Movies and TV\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\n56mm Dynamic Drivers\n\nNeeds Amplification\n\nReplaceable Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nOUTSTANDING REFERENCE QUALITY AUDIO REPRODUCTION\n\nThe Sennheiser HD 800s sport an open, circum-aural dynamic stereo headphone design that makes you feel directly connected to the music. Music emerges from silence and sounds so profound that would travel into a soundstage of amazement. Soundstage refers to being able to sense the spatial surroundings of a recording.\n\nPATENTED DYNAMIC TRANSDUCER TECHNOLOGY\n\nHeadphones have always had a basic physics problem when it comes to transducers. Better sound always requires a larger surface area but this also results in more distortion due to oscillation at high frequencies. Sennheiser essentially blew everyone’s mind when they showed off the Neodymium-powered two-layer ring radiator inside the HD 800 S. Firing at your ear in a strategic 60-degree angle to simulate free-air sound arrivals it has claimed to sport the largest diameter ever seen for such applications.\n\nRING RADIATOR DRIVER TECHNOLOGY FOR CONTROLLED OSCILLATIONS\n\nThe 56mm or 2.205\" (with a 40mm voice coil) is twice the size of your average tweeter. Generally, you don't encounter them until you shell out about 100 times that for the full speaker. This results in controlled oscillations, which leave the headphones to do what headphones do best, that is create the best and clearest sound possible.\n\nCOMFORTABLE CIRCUMAURAL DESIGN WITH ALCANTARA EARCUPS\n\nThe Japanese Alcantra Earcups boast of suede-like fabric material that you’ll find used for the interior of many high-end automobiles and racecars. It definitely feels like an airy version of suede, as it doesn't have the heft of most leather materials. Also the fabric breathes, which is great for long listening sessions when you don’t want to have to air out your ears. Handcrafted ear pads made of high-quality microfiber fabric and the ear cups are covered with a thin metallic mesh.\n\nINGENIOUS KEVLAR-REINFORCED CABLES FOR MINIMAL LOSS\n\n3 meters of fabric-sheathed Kevlar-reinforced Teflon-insulated 4-strand straight OFC copper wire in a Y harness. The cable is covered with a fabric sheath, making it flexible and non-microphonic. Two connection leads, a 6.3mm connector and an XLR-4 balanced cable to offer even better quality sound from sources with balanced outputs.\n\nOPEN-BACK DESIGN FOR AN AIRY, EXPANSIVE SOUNDSTAGE\n\nAny set of headphones that give a real sense of ‘being there’ are open-backed, meaning that air and sound can come in and out of the headphones. The sound has less of a ‘laboratory feel’ this way. It’s not great for noise isolation, as people will be able to hear whatever music or movies that you’re listening to.\n\nDESIGNED KEEPING WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION AND COMFORTABILITY IN MIND\n\nThe headphones come in at a pretty heavy sounding 11.5 oz (or 330 grams for the metric folk), but they manage to distribute the weight evenly so that you don’t really notice the weight at all. They are large headphones and cover even the largest of ears. But they feel light and after a two-hour film, your head won’t be sore at all.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nTRANSDUCER PRINCIPLE\nDynamic Open\n\nIMPEDANCE\n300 Ohms\n\nTHD\n0.02 % (1 kHz 1 Vrms)\n\nCONTACT PRESSURE\n~ 3,4 N (± 0,3 N)\n\nSENSITIVITY\n102 dB @ 1 kHz\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n4 – 51000 Hz (- 10 dB)\n\nMAX INPUT POWER\n700 mW\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nNeodymium\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n6.35 mm/ 4.4 mm XLR-4 (optional)\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-Ear\n\nWEIGHT\n330g\n\nCOLOR\nblack\n\nCABLE TYPE\nFabric-sheathed Kevlar-reinforced Teflon-insulated 4-strand straight OFC copper wire\n\nCABLE LENGTH\n3m\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

Read more on warranty claim here.\n\nWhats the difference between an Open-Back and Closed-Back headphone?\n\nWe have an article to help you understand better the difference between Open Back and Closed Back Headphones.\n\nDoes it have Noise Isolation?\n\nNo, It’s not great for noise isolation as it's an open back headphone and it won't shut out any external noise.\n\nHow do these sound?\n\nThe Sennheiser 800s sounds so amazing that it would make you feel like a live stage performance on every track.\n\nWill I need an Amp?\n\nThe Sennheiser HD800s will need an amp, we recommend you read our article on Why you may need an Amp to help you take a decision.\n\nWhat is the difference between 800 and 800s ?\n\nThe 800S driver is a modified version of the 800 driver. This new modified driver smooths over the 6 kHz peak on the 800 which some people thought made it sound fatiguing. It also makes the sound feel a bit more full bodied and comparatively warmer.\n\nHow do I know I'm making the right choice?\n\nWe understand that choosing a headphone can be a tough job having being given so many variations so this blog should help simplfy your doubts on the right choice on headphones\n\nBuying Guide\n\nBest Audiophile Headphones\nby Abhijeeth Shetty May 09, 2020\nThere are a lot of headphones available in the market posing themselves as audiophile headphones.

Schiit Yggdrasil\n\n2. Power cord\n\nFAQs\n\nSo this is your bestest brightest DAC? For only $2449?\n\nYes. We don't believe in fancy casework, nor in blingy displays, nor in any kind of complication that just ups the price for the sake of upping the price. So yes, this is our top DAC. A DAC that can look any other DAC in the world in the face and not flinch. That is, if it was human. And if DACs had faces. Hell, you know what we mean.\n\nHow can this possibly be better than, say, the Arglebargle $15,000 DAC when this is so much less expensive?\n\nBecause the Arglebargle was most likely designed to the expectations of today, using commonly available parts in a super-fancy case, while we started with a clean sheet of paper.\n\nBut the Arglebargle has like twelve 32-bit DACs in it! Yours only has 21 bits! Hell, that’s not a full 24 bits even! What about my 24-bit recordings?\n\nIf your 24 bit recordings actually have 24 bits of resolution, we’ll eat a hat. And those \"32-bit\" DACs? Well, they have this measurement known as “equivalent number of bits.” This means, in English, how many bits of resolution they really have. And that number, for most of them, is about 19.5.\n\nBut it’s only 21 bits! I can’t get over that!\n\nWe can’t get over the fact that delta-sigma DACs are actually 2- to 5-bit designs. Different strokes for different folks.\n\nWhat about DSD or MQA?\n\nYggdrasil plays DSD just fine, as long as it's converted to PCM by your software player. Same for MQA—Yggdrasil plays MQA just fine as long as your software or hardware does the \"unfolding.\" (Unspindling and unmutilating are, we suppose, extra.)\n\nWhat? But I hear DSD and/or MQA is the future!\n\nYeah, and reel-to-reel was the future in the 1970s, and it’s dead now, and DAT was the future in the 1980s, and it’s dead now, and HDCD was the future in the 1990s, and it’s dead now, and SACD was the future in the 2000s, and it’s dead now. But, let's say Sony suddenly opens their vaults and offers 30,000 DSD albums with guaranteed direct-from-DSD provenance at $5.99 each, or if Apple and Spotify and Amazon start streaming only MQA for free (yes, we know, stop laughing) then hey, Yggy is fully upgradable.\n\nWhat’s this bullschiit about a unique time- and frequency-domain optimized digital filter, and why does it matter?\n\nMost digital filters destroy the original samples in the process of upsampling. They’re just like sample rate converters or delta-sigma DACs. We’re all about the original samples, so we created a unique digital filter that performs a true interpolation, which means it retains all the original samples. This is a major difference between Schiit True Multibit DACs like Yggdrasil and every other DAC in the world.\n\nI don't believe you!\n\nThen ask Mike Moffat, the father of audiophile digital playback, about his 5-year quest to perfect this digital filter, involving 1917 Western Electric papers on pulse-code modulation, a professor emeritus of mathematics who devised a way to get around the divide-by-zero problem, a RAND corp mathematician to implement it, and a master programmer to get it to run on our SHARC processor engine. In his words:\"The below are the claims of the digital filter/interpolator/sample rate converter in Yggy: 1. The filter is absolutely proprietary. 2. The development tools and coefficient calculator to derive the above filters are also proprietary. 3. The math involved in developing the filter and calculating has a closed form solution. It is not an approximation, as all other filters I have studied (most, if not all of them). Therefore, all of the original samples are output. This could be referred to fairly as bit perfect; what comes in goes out. 4. Oversimplified, however essentially correct: The filter is also time domain optimized which means the phase info in the original samples are averaged in the time domain with the filter generated interpolated samples to for corrected minimum phase shift as a function of frequency from DC to the percentage of nyquist - in our case .968. Time domain is well defined at DC - the playback device behaves as a window fan at DC - it either blows (in phase) or sucks (out). It is our time domain optimization that gives the uncanny sonic hologram. (It also allows the filter to disappear. Has to be heard to understand.) Since lower frequency wavelengths are measured in tens of feet, placement in image gets increasingly wrong as a function of decreasing frequency in non time domain optimized recordings - these keep the listener's ability to hear the venue - not to mention the sum of all of the phase errors in the microphones, mixing boards, eq, etc on the record side. An absolute phase switch is of little to no value in a non time domain optimized, stochastic time domain replay system. It makes a huge difference with an Yggy. 5. This is combined with a frequency domain optimization which does not otherwise affect the phase optimization. The 0.968 of Nyquist also gives us a small advantage that none of the off-the shelf FIR filters (0.907) provide: frequency response out to 21.344KHz, 42.688KHz, 85.3776KHz, and 170.5772KHz bandwidth for native 1,2,4, and 8x 44.1KHz SR multiple recordings - the 48KHz table is 23.232, 46.464, 92.868, and 185.856KHz respectively for 1,2,4, and 8x. This was the portion of the filter that had the divide by zero problem which John Lediaev worked out, to combine with #4 above AND retain the original samples. This is what other DACs typically offer: frequency domain optimization FIR filters with Parks-McClellan optimization. Any avoidance of the Parks-McClellan pablum requires a lot of original DSP work. Am I a prophet who received the tablets from God or some other high-end audio drivel. Hell, no. I was the producer and director of this project and worked with Dave Kerstetter (hardware-software), John Lediaev (Math), Tom Lippiat (DSP Code), Warren Goldman (Coefficient Generator and development tools) for a total of 15 or so man years. These folks either taught math at The University of Iowa, Computer Science at Carnegie-Mellon University, worked at think tanks like the Rand Corporation – you get the idea. We did this for no money - What we all had in common was that we loved audio. All other audio pros were interested in Parks-McClellan and pointed and laughed at us. That's the way it happened. It was worth it, every hour, day, and year.\"\n\nWhat is Unison USB?\n\nUnison USB is our own proprietary USB input, not based on C-Media or XMOS or any other off-the-shelf USB receiver out there. Instead, we spent a couple of person-years developing our own code for a standard Microchip PIC32 microprocessor, which allowed us to create a higher-performing USB input than anything else on the market.\n\nBut, USB inputs, like, kinda suck.\n\nNot Unison USB. Even Mike Moffat, the famous “friends don’t let friends use USB” guy, prefers Unison to SPDIF.\n\nSo why is Unison USB so special?\n\nUnison USB is special because it was developed for a single purpose: to provide the highest performance input for PCM digital, period. It doesn’t have ten thousand un-used functions, nor is it trying to optimize for five different unicorn formats that will probably be gone tomorrow. It also uses very high-quality local clocks and offers complete electrostatic and electromagnetic isolation from the source. It also provides lower power draw and complete UAC2 compatibility.\n\nSo what platforms does your Unison USB input support?\n\nActually, the question should be “What platforms support your Unison USB input?” since our Unison USB input is 100% UAC2 compliant (that is, USB Audio Class 2, the accepted standard for USB audio transmission.) So, here you go:\n\nLinux. As in, most popular streamers, from the Sonore MicroRendu to the Salk Streamer. Note “most.” Also most Linux distros that support UAC2 natively will be plug and play. Please note that we cannot provide detailed technical support for Linux.\n\nWindows 10. Yes, Windows 10 only. We don’t provide UAC2 drivers for earlier versions of Windows, sorry. Yes, it is time to step into the present (not the future, Windows 10 has been out for a couple of years now.) Yes, it is time to upgrade. Yes, it’s worth it. Windows 10 is actually a very nice platform.\n\nMac OSX. From 10.10 on up, Macs are good to go. Sometimes you’ll run into power management problems that will require you to turn off App Nap. Got an older version of MacOS? See the comments on Windows above. Time to upgrade. The software is free.\n\niOS. From iOS7 on up, iOS devices work with USB Camera Connection Kit, Lightning to USB Camera Adapter, a Lightning to USB3 Camera Adapter, or directly with the new USB-C models.\n\nAndroid. Most Android devices that shipped with Android M or above will work using a USB OTG cable. Some may require separate player software, like USB Audio Player Pro.\n\nHow about the DACs and analog stage?\n\nThe DACs we're using—AD5791—were billed as \"the industry's first true 20-bit DAC\" by Analog Devices when they were introduced in 2010. Note the words \"first\" and \"true.\" This is not 20-bit as defined for audio applications, this is not 24-bit delta-sigma, this is not (nudge, snicker) \"32 bit\" complete fantasy stuff. These DACs have never been used in an audio product until Yggdrasil. Normally, they are used for medical device imaging and weapons targeting—applications in which accuracy is absolutely paramount. Now, we're using 4 of the highest-spec AD5791BRUZ in this product—2 each per channel, for true differential hardware balanced design. Beyond that, a fully discrete, DC-coupled, Class A FET buffer stage and fully discrete FET summers (for the single-ended output) complete the picture.\n\nSo how come everyone isn't using the AD5791, if it's so great?\n\nBecause they require very, very special care and feeding. AD5791s aren't \"bolt in and go\" DACs, with pleasant little paint-by-numbers application notes for use with audio. They don't even accept normal digital audio formats. Managing their use with multiple input bit depths and sample rates is, well, challenging. And special care has to be taken with their output. Plus, people are more focused on silly claims like \"32-bit\" DACs and \"Giga-Rate\" DSD. \"21 real bits,\" doesn't sound real sexy in that context.\n\nWait, what is this about 32-bit music?\n\nHow much 32 bit music do you have? (Not that it will ever exist—we can't get the noise floor that low. Period. Unless Dr. Who pays us a visit and drops some alien tech on us...)\n\nYou guys are crazy!\n\nYes. We know that. And so are you. You're considering a $2,300, 25-lb product that does the same basic thing as a $0.32 chip in your iPhone.\n\nOkay, fine, I get the picture. Change of subject: is this thing upgradable?\n\nYggdrasil is built for the future. The main board is nothing more than a motherboard and power supply. From there, separate, plug-in modules are used for the input board, the USB board, the processor/DSP board, and the separate analog boards. This means that any part of Yggdrasil can be updated as standards change.\n\nHow do I know I have the Unison USB input?\n\nUnison USB is indicated with a separate sticker near the USB input.\n\nHow do I know I have the new \"Analog 2\" output?\n\nYour serial number will start with a \"B.\"\n\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n5 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Schiit Yggdrasil comes with a 5 year warranty from Schiit that covers manufacturing defects. All products featured on Headphone Zone are backed by an original manufacturer's warranty. Read more about Schiit's warranty in India.\n\n\"In the end the Yggdrasil's sound pulled me in more. It wins by doing less, it is a slightly softer sound, but one that keeps me coming back.\"\nRead More\n\n\"It’s built amazingly well, there’s inputs and outputs for whatever you’d likely need, it sexy to look at, and my goodness does it make your audio sound true to real life.\"\nRead More",

This means it retains all the original samples, performing a true interpolation. This digital filter gives you the best of both NOS (all original samples retained) and upsampling (easier filtering of out-of-band noise) designs.\n\nHIGH-QUALITY INPUT SYSTEM\n\nThe Yggdrasil features Schiit's all-new USB Gen 3 input module for exceptional USB input performance. It accepts up to 5 digital inputs and carefully manages them with the Adapticlock™ regeneration system. This is the most sophisticated clock management system in the world which assesses the quality of all inputs, measures their incoming centre frequency and jitter, while automatically routing the input to the best clock regeneration system.\n\nSPECS\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nINPUTS\nAES/EBU XLR, RCA SPDIF, BNC SPDIF, Optical SPDIF, USB\n\nINPUT COMPATIBILITY\nup to 24/192 for all inputs\n\nINPUT RECEIVER, SPDIF\nAKM AK4113\n\nINPUT RECEIVER, USB\nC-Media CM6631A\n\nOUTPUT\nOne pair XLR balanced and two pairs RCA single-ended\n\nOUTPUT IMPEDANCE\n75 ohms\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE, ANALOG STAGE\n20Hz-20Khz, +/-0.1dB, 0.5Hz-200KHz, -1dB\n\nMAXIMUM OUTPUT\n4.0V RMS (balanced), 2.0V RMS (single-ended)\n\nTHD\nLess than 0.005%, 20Hz-20KHz, at full output\n\nIMD\n< 0.005%, CCIF, at full output\n\nSNR\n119dB, referenced to 2V RMS\n\nUPGRADABILITY\nFully modular architecture.

Schiit Yggdrasil\n\n2. Power cord\n\nFAQs\n\nSo this is your bestest brightest DAC? For only $2449?\n\nYes. We don't believe in fancy casework, nor in blingy displays, nor in any kind of complication that just ups the price for the sake of upping the price. So yes, this is our top DAC. A DAC that can look any other DAC in the world in the face and not flinch. That is, if it was human. And if DACs had faces. Hell, you know what we mean.\n\nHow can this possibly be better than, say, the Arglebargle $15,000 DAC when this is so much less expensive?\n\nBecause the Arglebargle was most likely designed to the expectations of today, using commonly available parts in a super-fancy case, while we started with a clean sheet of paper.\n\nBut the Arglebargle has like twelve 32-bit DACs in it! Yours only has 21 bits! Hell, that’s not a full 24 bits even! What about my 24-bit recordings?\n\nIf your 24 bit recordings actually have 24 bits of resolution, we’ll eat a hat. And those \"32-bit\" DACs? Well, they have this measurement known as “equivalent number of bits.” This means, in English, how many bits of resolution they really have. And that number, for most of them, is about 19.5.\n\nBut it’s only 21 bits! I can’t get over that!\n\nWe can’t get over the fact that delta-sigma DACs are actually 2- to 5-bit designs. Different strokes for different folks.\n\nWhat about DSD or MQA?\n\nYggdrasil plays DSD just fine, as long as it's converted to PCM by your software player. Same for MQA—Yggdrasil plays MQA just fine as long as your software or hardware does the \"unfolding.\" (Unspindling and unmutilating are, we suppose, extra.)\n\nWhat? But I hear DSD and/or MQA is the future!\n\nYeah, and reel-to-reel was the future in the 1970s, and it’s dead now, and DAT was the future in the 1980s, and it’s dead now, and HDCD was the future in the 1990s, and it’s dead now, and SACD was the future in the 2000s, and it’s dead now. But, let's say Sony suddenly opens their vaults and offers 30,000 DSD albums with guaranteed direct-from-DSD provenance at $5.99 each, or if Apple and Spotify and Amazon start streaming only MQA for free (yes, we know, stop laughing) then hey, Yggy is fully upgradable.\n\nWhat’s this bullschiit about a unique time- and frequency-domain optimized digital filter, and why does it matter?\n\nMost digital filters destroy the original samples in the process of upsampling. They’re just like sample rate converters or delta-sigma DACs. We’re all about the original samples, so we created a unique digital filter that performs a true interpolation, which means it retains all the original samples.

In his words:\"The below are the claims of the digital filter/interpolator/sample rate converter in Yggy: 1. The filter is absolutely proprietary. 2.

Schiit Yggdrasil\n\n2. Power cord\n\nFAQs\n\nSo this is your bestest brightest DAC? For only $2449?\n\nYes. We don't believe in fancy casework, nor in blingy displays, nor in any kind of complication that just ups the price for the sake of upping the price. So yes, this is our top DAC. A DAC that can look any other DAC in the world in the face and not flinch. That is, if it was human. And if DACs had faces. Hell, you know what we mean.\n\nHow can this possibly be better than, say, the Arglebargle $15,000 DAC when this is so much less expensive?\n\nBecause the Arglebargle was most likely designed to the expectations of today, using commonly available parts in a super-fancy case, while we started with a clean sheet of paper.\n\nBut the Arglebargle has like twelve 32-bit DACs in it! Yours only has 21 bits! Hell, that’s not a full 24 bits even! What about my 24-bit recordings?\n\nIf your 24 bit recordings actually have 24 bits of resolution, we’ll eat a hat. And those \"32-bit\" DACs? Well, they have this measurement known as “equivalent number of bits.” This means, in English, how many bits of resolution they really have. And that number, for most of them, is about 19.5.\n\nBut it’s only 21 bits! I can’t get over that!\n\nWe can’t get over the fact that delta-sigma DACs are actually 2- to 5-bit designs. Different strokes for different folks.\n\nWhat about DSD or MQA?\n\nYggdrasil plays DSD just fine, as long as it's converted to PCM by your software player. Same for MQA—Yggdrasil plays MQA just fine as long as your software or hardware does the \"unfolding.\" (Unspindling and unmutilating are, we suppose, extra.)\n\nWhat? But I hear DSD and/or MQA is the future!\n\nYeah, and reel-to-reel was the future in the 1970s, and it’s dead now, and DAT was the future in the 1980s, and it’s dead now, and HDCD was the future in the 1990s, and it’s dead now, and SACD was the future in the 2000s, and it’s dead now. But, let's say Sony suddenly opens their vaults and offers 30,000 DSD albums with guaranteed direct-from-DSD provenance at $5.99 each, or if Apple and Spotify and Amazon start streaming only MQA for free (yes, we know, stop laughing) then hey, Yggy is fully upgradable.\n\nWhat’s this bullschiit about a unique time- and frequency-domain optimized digital filter, and why does it matter?\n\nMost digital filters destroy the original samples in the process of upsampling. They’re just like sample rate converters or delta-sigma DACs. We’re all about the original samples, so we created a unique digital filter that performs a true interpolation, which means it retains all the original samples. This is a major difference between Schiit True Multibit DACs like Yggdrasil and every other DAC in the world.\n\nI don't believe you!\n\nThen ask Mike Moffat, the father of audiophile digital playback, about his 5-year quest to perfect this digital filter, involving 1917 Western Electric papers on pulse-code modulation, a professor emeritus of mathematics who devised a way to get around the divide-by-zero problem, a RAND corp mathematician to implement it, and a master programmer to get it to run on our SHARC processor engine. In his words:\"The below are the claims of the digital filter/interpolator/sample rate converter in Yggy: 1. The filter is absolutely proprietary. 2. The development tools and coefficient calculator to derive the above filters are also proprietary. 3. The math involved in developing the filter and calculating has a closed form solution. It is not an approximation, as all other filters I have studied (most, if not all of them). Therefore, all of the original samples are output. This could be referred to fairly as bit perfect; what comes in goes out. 4. Oversimplified, however essentially correct: The filter is also time domain optimized which means the phase info in the original samples are averaged in the time domain with the filter generated interpolated samples to for corrected minimum phase shift as a function of frequency from DC to the percentage of nyquist - in our case .968. Time domain is well defined at DC - the playback device behaves as a window fan at DC - it either blows (in phase) or sucks (out). It is our time domain optimization that gives the uncanny sonic hologram. (It also allows the filter to disappear. Has to be heard to understand.) Since lower frequency wavelengths are measured in tens of feet, placement in image gets increasingly wrong as a function of decreasing frequency in non time domain optimized recordings - these keep the listener's ability to hear the venue - not to mention the sum of all of the phase errors in the microphones, mixing boards, eq, etc on the record side. An absolute phase switch is of little to no value in a non time domain optimized, stochastic time domain replay system. It makes a huge difference with an Yggy. 5. This is combined with a frequency domain optimization which does not otherwise affect the phase optimization. The 0.968 of Nyquist also gives us a small advantage that none of the off-the shelf FIR filters (0.907) provide: frequency response out to 21.344KHz, 42.688KHz, 85.3776KHz, and 170.5772KHz bandwidth for native 1,2,4, and 8x 44.1KHz SR multiple recordings - the 48KHz table is 23.232, 46.464, 92.868, and 185.856KHz respectively for 1,2,4, and 8x. This was the portion of the filter that had the divide by zero problem which John Lediaev worked out, to combine with #4 above AND retain the original samples. This is what other DACs typically offer: frequency domain optimization FIR filters with Parks-McClellan optimization. Any avoidance of the Parks-McClellan pablum requires a lot of original DSP work. Am I a prophet who received the tablets from God or some other high-end audio drivel. Hell, no. I was the producer and director of this project and worked with Dave Kerstetter (hardware-software), John Lediaev (Math), Tom Lippiat (DSP Code), Warren Goldman (Coefficient Generator and development tools) for a total of 15 or so man years. These folks either taught math at The University of Iowa, Computer Science at Carnegie-Mellon University, worked at think tanks like the Rand Corporation – you get the idea. We did this for no money - What we all had in common was that we loved audio. All other audio pros were interested in Parks-McClellan and pointed and laughed at us. That's the way it happened. It was worth it, every hour, day, and year.\"\n\nWhat is Unison USB?\n\nUnison USB is our own proprietary USB input, not based on C-Media or XMOS or any other off-the-shelf USB receiver out there. Instead, we spent a couple of person-years developing our own code for a standard Microchip PIC32 microprocessor, which allowed us to create a higher-performing USB input than anything else on the market.\n\nBut, USB inputs, like, kinda suck.\n\nNot Unison USB. Even Mike Moffat, the famous “friends don’t let friends use USB” guy, prefers Unison to SPDIF.\n\nSo why is Unison USB so special?\n\nUnison USB is special because it was developed for a single purpose: to provide the highest performance input for PCM digital, period. It doesn’t have ten thousand un-used functions, nor is it trying to optimize for five different unicorn formats that will probably be gone tomorrow. It also uses very high-quality local clocks and offers complete electrostatic and electromagnetic isolation from the source. It also provides lower power draw and complete UAC2 compatibility.\n\nSo what platforms does your Unison USB input support?\n\nActually, the question should be “What platforms support your Unison USB input?” since our Unison USB input is 100% UAC2 compliant (that is, USB Audio Class 2, the accepted standard for USB audio transmission.) So, here you go:\n\nLinux. As in, most popular streamers, from the Sonore MicroRendu to the Salk Streamer. Note “most.” Also most Linux distros that support UAC2 natively will be plug and play. Please note that we cannot provide detailed technical support for Linux.\n\nWindows 10. Yes, Windows 10 only. We don’t provide UAC2 drivers for earlier versions of Windows, sorry. Yes, it is time to step into the present (not the future, Windows 10 has been out for a couple of years now.) Yes, it is time to upgrade. Yes, it’s worth it. Windows 10 is actually a very nice platform.\n\nMac OSX. From 10.10 on up, Macs are good to go. Sometimes you’ll run into power management problems that will require you to turn off App Nap. Got an older version of MacOS? See the comments on Windows above. Time to upgrade. The software is free.\n\niOS. From iOS7 on up, iOS devices work with USB Camera Connection Kit, Lightning to USB Camera Adapter, a Lightning to USB3 Camera Adapter, or directly with the new USB-C models.\n\nAndroid. Most Android devices that shipped with Android M or above will work using a USB OTG cable. Some may require separate player software, like USB Audio Player Pro.\n\nHow about the DACs and analog stage?\n\nThe DACs we're using—AD5791—were billed as \"the industry's first true 20-bit DAC\" by Analog Devices when they were introduced in 2010. Note the words \"first\" and \"true.\" This is not 20-bit as defined for audio applications, this is not 24-bit delta-sigma, this is not (nudge, snicker) \"32 bit\" complete fantasy stuff. These DACs have never been used in an audio product until Yggdrasil. Normally, they are used for medical device imaging and weapons targeting—applications in which accuracy is absolutely paramount. Now, we're using 4 of the highest-spec AD5791BRUZ in this product—2 each per channel, for true differential hardware balanced design. Beyond that, a fully discrete, DC-coupled, Class A FET buffer stage and fully discrete FET summers (for the single-ended output) complete the picture.\n\nSo how come everyone isn't using the AD5791, if it's so great?\n\nBecause they require very, very special care and feeding. AD5791s aren't \"bolt in and go\" DACs, with pleasant little paint-by-numbers application notes for use with audio. They don't even accept normal digital audio formats. Managing their use with multiple input bit depths and sample rates is, well, challenging. And special care has to be taken with their output. Plus, people are more focused on silly claims like \"32-bit\" DACs and \"Giga-Rate\" DSD. \"21 real bits,\" doesn't sound real sexy in that context.\n\nWait, what is this about 32-bit music?\n\nHow much 32 bit music do you have? (Not that it will ever exist—we can't get the noise floor that low. Period. Unless Dr. Who pays us a visit and drops some alien tech on us...)\n\nYou guys are crazy!\n\nYes. We know that. And so are you. You're considering a $2,300, 25-lb product that does the same basic thing as a $0.32 chip in your iPhone.\n\nOkay, fine, I get the picture. Change of subject: is this thing upgradable?\n\nYggdrasil is built for the future. The main board is nothing more than a motherboard and power supply. From there, separate, plug-in modules are used for the input board, the USB board, the processor/DSP board, and the separate analog boards. This means that any part of Yggdrasil can be updated as standards change.\n\nHow do I know I have the Unison USB input?\n\nUnison USB is indicated with a separate sticker near the USB input.\n\nHow do I know I have the new \"Analog 2\" output?\n\nYour serial number will start with a \"B.\"\n\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n5 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Schiit Yggdrasil comes with a 5 year warranty from Schiit that covers manufacturing defects.

Schiit Yggdrasil\n\n2. Power cord\n\nFAQs\n\nSo this is your bestest brightest DAC? For only $2449?\n\nYes. We don't believe in fancy casework, nor in blingy displays, nor in any kind of complication that just ups the price for the sake of upping the price. So yes, this is our top DAC. A DAC that can look any other DAC in the world in the face and not flinch. That is, if it was human. And if DACs had faces. Hell, you know what we mean.\n\nHow can this possibly be better than, say, the Arglebargle $15,000 DAC when this is so much less expensive?\n\nBecause the Arglebargle was most likely designed to the expectations of today, using commonly available parts in a super-fancy case, while we started with a clean sheet of paper.\n\nBut the Arglebargle has like twelve 32-bit DACs in it! Yours only has 21 bits! Hell, that’s not a full 24 bits even! What about my 24-bit recordings?\n\nIf your 24 bit recordings actually have 24 bits of resolution, we’ll eat a hat. And those \"32-bit\" DACs? Well, they have this measurement known as “equivalent number of bits.” This means, in English, how many bits of resolution they really have. And that number, for most of them, is about 19.5.\n\nBut it’s only 21 bits! I can’t get over that!\n\nWe can’t get over the fact that delta-sigma DACs are actually 2- to 5-bit designs. Different strokes for different folks.\n\nWhat about DSD or MQA?\n\nYggdrasil plays DSD just fine, as long as it's converted to PCM by your software player. Same for MQA—Yggdrasil plays MQA just fine as long as your software or hardware does the \"unfolding.\" (Unspindling and unmutilating are, we suppose, extra.)\n\nWhat? But I hear DSD and/or MQA is the future!\n\nYeah, and reel-to-reel was the future in the 1970s, and it’s dead now, and DAT was the future in the 1980s, and it’s dead now, and HDCD was the future in the 1990s, and it’s dead now, and SACD was the future in the 2000s, and it’s dead now. But, let's say Sony suddenly opens their vaults and offers 30,000 DSD albums with guaranteed direct-from-DSD provenance at $5.99 each, or if Apple and Spotify and Amazon start streaming only MQA for free (yes, we know, stop laughing) then hey, Yggy is fully upgradable.\n\nWhat’s this bullschiit about a unique time- and frequency-domain optimized digital filter, and why does it matter?\n\nMost digital filters destroy the original samples in the process of upsampling. They’re just like sample rate converters or delta-sigma DACs. We’re all about the original samples, so we created a unique digital filter that performs a true interpolation, which means it retains all the original samples. This is a major difference between Schiit True Multibit DACs like Yggdrasil and every other DAC in the world.\n\nI don't believe you!\n\nThen ask Mike Moffat, the father of audiophile digital playback, about his 5-year quest to perfect this digital filter, involving 1917 Western Electric papers on pulse-code modulation, a professor emeritus of mathematics who devised a way to get around the divide-by-zero problem, a RAND corp mathematician to implement it, and a master programmer to get it to run on our SHARC processor engine. In his words:\"The below are the claims of the digital filter/interpolator/sample rate converter in Yggy: 1. The filter is absolutely proprietary. 2. The development tools and coefficient calculator to derive the above filters are also proprietary. 3. The math involved in developing the filter and calculating has a closed form solution. It is not an approximation, as all other filters I have studied (most, if not all of them). Therefore, all of the original samples are output. This could be referred to fairly as bit perfect; what comes in goes out. 4. Oversimplified, however essentially correct: The filter is also time domain optimized which means the phase info in the original samples are averaged in the time domain with the filter generated interpolated samples to for corrected minimum phase shift as a function of frequency from DC to the percentage of nyquist - in our case .968. Time domain is well defined at DC - the playback device behaves as a window fan at DC - it either blows (in phase) or sucks (out). It is our time domain optimization that gives the uncanny sonic hologram. (It also allows the filter to disappear. Has to be heard to understand.) Since lower frequency wavelengths are measured in tens of feet, placement in image gets increasingly wrong as a function of decreasing frequency in non time domain optimized recordings - these keep the listener's ability to hear the venue - not to mention the sum of all of the phase errors in the microphones, mixing boards, eq, etc on the record side. An absolute phase switch is of little to no value in a non time domain optimized, stochastic time domain replay system. It makes a huge difference with an Yggy. 5. This is combined with a frequency domain optimization which does not otherwise affect the phase optimization. The 0.968 of Nyquist also gives us a small advantage that none of the off-the shelf FIR filters (0.907) provide: frequency response out to 21.344KHz, 42.688KHz, 85.3776KHz, and 170.5772KHz bandwidth for native 1,2,4, and 8x 44.1KHz SR multiple recordings - the 48KHz table is 23.232, 46.464, 92.868, and 185.856KHz respectively for 1,2,4, and 8x. This was the portion of the filter that had the divide by zero problem which John Lediaev worked out, to combine with #4 above AND retain the original samples. This is what other DACs typically offer: frequency domain optimization FIR filters with Parks-McClellan optimization. Any avoidance of the Parks-McClellan pablum requires a lot of original DSP work. Am I a prophet who received the tablets from God or some other high-end audio drivel. Hell, no. I was the producer and director of this project and worked with Dave Kerstetter (hardware-software), John Lediaev (Math), Tom Lippiat (DSP Code), Warren Goldman (Coefficient Generator and development tools) for a total of 15 or so man years. These folks either taught math at The University of Iowa, Computer Science at Carnegie-Mellon University, worked at think tanks like the Rand Corporation – you get the idea. We did this for no money - What we all had in common was that we loved audio. All other audio pros were interested in Parks-McClellan and pointed and laughed at us. That's the way it happened. It was worth it, every hour, day, and year.\"\n\nWhat is Unison USB?\n\nUnison USB is our own proprietary USB input, not based on C-Media or XMOS or any other off-the-shelf USB receiver out there. Instead, we spent a couple of person-years developing our own code for a standard Microchip PIC32 microprocessor, which allowed us to create a higher-performing USB input than anything else on the market.\n\nBut, USB inputs, like, kinda suck.\n\nNot Unison USB. Even Mike Moffat, the famous “friends don’t let friends use USB” guy, prefers Unison to SPDIF.\n\nSo why is Unison USB so special?\n\nUnison USB is special because it was developed for a single purpose: to provide the highest performance input for PCM digital, period. It doesn’t have ten thousand un-used functions, nor is it trying to optimize for five different unicorn formats that will probably be gone tomorrow. It also uses very high-quality local clocks and offers complete electrostatic and electromagnetic isolation from the source. It also provides lower power draw and complete UAC2 compatibility.\n\nSo what platforms does your Unison USB input support?\n\nActually, the question should be “What platforms support your Unison USB input?” since our Unison USB input is 100% UAC2 compliant (that is, USB Audio Class 2, the accepted standard for USB audio transmission.) So, here you go:\n\nLinux. As in, most popular streamers, from the Sonore MicroRendu to the Salk Streamer. Note “most.” Also most Linux distros that support UAC2 natively will be plug and play. Please note that we cannot provide detailed technical support for Linux.\n\nWindows 10. Yes, Windows 10 only. We don’t provide UAC2 drivers for earlier versions of Windows, sorry. Yes, it is time to step into the present (not the future, Windows 10 has been out for a couple of years now.) Yes, it is time to upgrade. Yes, it’s worth it. Windows 10 is actually a very nice platform.\n\nMac OSX. From 10.10 on up, Macs are good to go. Sometimes you’ll run into power management problems that will require you to turn off App Nap. Got an older version of MacOS? See the comments on Windows above. Time to upgrade. The software is free.\n\niOS. From iOS7 on up, iOS devices work with USB Camera Connection Kit, Lightning to USB Camera Adapter, a Lightning to USB3 Camera Adapter, or directly with the new USB-C models.\n\nAndroid. Most Android devices that shipped with Android M or above will work using a USB OTG cable. Some may require separate player software, like USB Audio Player Pro.\n\nHow about the DACs and analog stage?\n\nThe DACs we're using—AD5791—were billed as \"the industry's first true 20-bit DAC\" by Analog Devices when they were introduced in 2010. Note the words \"first\" and \"true.\" This is not 20-bit as defined for audio applications, this is not 24-bit delta-sigma, this is not (nudge, snicker) \"32 bit\" complete fantasy stuff. These DACs have never been used in an audio product until Yggdrasil. Normally, they are used for medical device imaging and weapons targeting—applications in which accuracy is absolutely paramount. Now, we're using 4 of the highest-spec AD5791BRUZ in this product—2 each per channel, for true differential hardware balanced design. Beyond that, a fully discrete, DC-coupled, Class A FET buffer stage and fully discrete FET summers (for the single-ended output) complete the picture.\n\nSo how come everyone isn't using the AD5791, if it's so great?\n\nBecause they require very, very special care and feeding. AD5791s aren't \"bolt in and go\" DACs, with pleasant little paint-by-numbers application notes for use with audio. They don't even accept normal digital audio formats. Managing their use with multiple input bit depths and sample rates is, well, challenging. And special care has to be taken with their output. Plus, people are more focused on silly claims like \"32-bit\" DACs and \"Giga-Rate\" DSD. \"21 real bits,\" doesn't sound real sexy in that context.\n\nWait, what is this about 32-bit music?\n\nHow much 32 bit music do you have? (Not that it will ever exist—we can't get the noise floor that low. Period. Unless Dr. Who pays us a visit and drops some alien tech on us...)\n\nYou guys are crazy!\n\nYes. We know that. And so are you. You're considering a $2,300, 25-lb product that does the same basic thing as a $0.32 chip in your iPhone.\n\nOkay, fine, I get the picture. Change of subject: is this thing upgradable?\n\nYggdrasil is built for the future. The main board is nothing more than a motherboard and power supply. From there, separate, plug-in modules are used for the input board, the USB board, the processor/DSP board, and the separate analog boards. This means that any part of Yggdrasil can be updated as standards change.\n\nHow do I know I have the Unison USB input?\n\nUnison USB is indicated with a separate sticker near the USB input.\n\nHow do I know I have the new \"Analog 2\" output?\n\nYour serial number will start with a \"B.\"\n\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n5 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Schiit Yggdrasil comes with a 5 year warranty from Schiit that covers manufacturing defects.

Schiit - Mani\n\n2. Wall-Wart\n\nFAQs\n\nWhoa. I didn’t know you guys were into vinyl?\n\nSure! Why not? I mean, it’s not like all the records ever pressed suddenly went up in smoke when CDs first came on the scene. Nor did they slip into an alternate universe when everyone started using iPods. (Both of these events to the great consternation of the recording industry, we’re sure.) Bottom line, there’s a ton of great music out there on vinyl—and today, there’s even more coming. Vinyl is the only physical media that increased in sales the past couple of years, and you may have noticed that more and more bands are releasing their work on vinyl.\n\nWell, isn’t that just a passing fad?\n\nWe don’t think so. Vinyl, played back on an accurate and resolving system, is an amazing-sounding medium. Many audiophiles still prefer the sound of vinyl to digital. We don’t think that will change soon. But even if it does, with Mani, you’re not out big bucks.\n\nSo who's the nut behind this wheel? Who designed it?\n\nYou can blame this one on Mike Moffat.\n\nWait, the father of audiophile digital audio is doing analog stuff?!?\n\nYep. Really says something, doesn't it?\n\nIsn't that kinda like, well, cross-dressing?\n\nAsk Mike about that one. Record the answer and put it on YouTube. Might be fun!\n\nOkay, I'll behave. What’s the big deal about Mani?\n\nThe big deal is that it really blows up the price/performance ratio for small, versatile MM/MC phono preamps—without compromises. Mani’s RIAA stage is fully passive (commonly considered the best way to do RIAA). It uses precision parts throughout, including 2% tolerance film capacitors and 0.5% thin-film resistors. It has great flexibility for both moving coil and moving magnet cartridges—in fact, it’s the only phono preamp anywhere near this price that offers two independently switchable gain stages for four selectable levels of gain. It uses very low-noise gain stages for extremely quiet performance. It has a linear power supply (no switchers here!) with an AC wall-wart off-board for even lower noise. And, it just sounds great! Go ahead and compare Mani to products costing 2-4x more, and we think you’ll come back very, very impressed.\n\nI have an inexpensive entry-level turntable with a decent moving-magnet cartridge. Is Mani for me?\n\nAbsolutely. It will allow you to wring the best performance out of your turntable, and move up the scale to even better performance with higher-end cartridges, if you choose to go there.\n\nI have a mid-priced turntable with an MC cartridge I picked up for $250. Is Mani for me?\n\nAbsolutely. It has all the performance you need until you get into very rarified strata of audiophilia.\n\nI have a weird cartridge that’s kinda between an MM and MC in terms of output. Is Mani for me?\n\nYes, Mani has the flexibility you need for high-output MC and low-output MM cartridges, thanks to its four gain levels.\n\nI need special custom loading options for my specific cartridge, can you do that?\n\nUnfortunately, no. At this price point, we can only build them one way. However, you can consider tweaking it with external loads.\n\nWell, you know, I’m very serious about vinyl, I have a $5,000 tube phono stage and a $15,000 turntable with a $2,500 cartridge. Is Mani for me?\n\nProbably not, but you may be surprised by how good it sounds. Consider Mani for a second table, or to recommend to friends who are “vinyl curious.”\n\nWow, you guys are being pretty serious. What happened?\n\nWe took our pills today. But don’t worry, we’re not going to put Mani up on a pedestal and set up velvet rope barriers and only allow tedious obsessives to listen to it. Mani is still all about having fun with your music. Because if you aren’t having fun with your system, your system is having fun with you!\n\nWhat the hell is a Mani?\n\nIt means “peanut butter” in Spanish. But, more seriously, Mani is the personification of the moon in Norse mythology. And the moon is round. And records are round. And the night is black. And records are black. Yeah, we’re kinda simple around here. But we do make some decent electronics.\n\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n2 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Schiit Mani comes with a 2 year warranty from Schiit that covers manufacturing defects.

Schiit - Mani\n\n2. Wall-Wart\n\nFAQs\n\nWhoa. I didn’t know you guys were into vinyl?\n\nSure! Why not? I mean, it’s not like all the records ever pressed suddenly went up in smoke when CDs first came on the scene. Nor did they slip into an alternate universe when everyone started using iPods. (Both of these events to the great consternation of the recording industry, we’re sure.) Bottom line, there’s a ton of great music out there on vinyl—and today, there’s even more coming. Vinyl is the only physical media that increased in sales the past couple of years, and you may have noticed that more and more bands are releasing their work on vinyl.\n\nWell, isn’t that just a passing fad?\n\nWe don’t think so. Vinyl, played back on an accurate and resolving system, is an amazing-sounding medium. Many audiophiles still prefer the sound of vinyl to digital. We don’t think that will change soon. But even if it does, with Mani, you’re not out big bucks.\n\nSo who's the nut behind this wheel? Who designed it?\n\nYou can blame this one on Mike Moffat.\n\nWait, the father of audiophile digital audio is doing analog stuff?!?\n\nYep. Really says something, doesn't it?\n\nIsn't that kinda like, well, cross-dressing?\n\nAsk Mike about that one. Record the answer and put it on YouTube. Might be fun!\n\nOkay, I'll behave. What’s the big deal about Mani?\n\nThe big deal is that it really blows up the price/performance ratio for small, versatile MM/MC phono preamps—without compromises. Mani’s RIAA stage is fully passive (commonly considered the best way to do RIAA). It uses precision parts throughout, including 2% tolerance film capacitors and 0.5% thin-film resistors. It has great flexibility for both moving coil and moving magnet cartridges—in fact, it’s the only phono preamp anywhere near this price that offers two independently switchable gain stages for four selectable levels of gain. It uses very low-noise gain stages for extremely quiet performance. It has a linear power supply (no switchers here!) with an AC wall-wart off-board for even lower noise. And, it just sounds great! Go ahead and compare Mani to products costing 2-4x more, and we think you’ll come back very, very impressed.\n\nI have an inexpensive entry-level turntable with a decent moving-magnet cartridge. Is Mani for me?\n\nAbsolutely. It will allow you to wring the best performance out of your turntable, and move up the scale to even better performance with higher-end cartridges, if you choose to go there.\n\nI have a mid-priced turntable with an MC cartridge I picked up for $250. Is Mani for me?\n\nAbsolutely. It has all the performance you need until you get into very rarified strata of audiophilia.\n\nI have a weird cartridge that’s kinda between an MM and MC in terms of output. Is Mani for me?\n\nYes, Mani has the flexibility you need for high-output MC and low-output MM cartridges, thanks to its four gain levels.\n\nI need special custom loading options for my specific cartridge, can you do that?\n\nUnfortunately, no. At this price point, we can only build them one way. However, you can consider tweaking it with external loads.\n\nWell, you know, I’m very serious about vinyl, I have a $5,000 tube phono stage and a $15,000 turntable with a $2,500 cartridge. Is Mani for me?\n\nProbably not, but you may be surprised by how good it sounds. Consider Mani for a second table, or to recommend to friends who are “vinyl curious.”\n\nWow, you guys are being pretty serious. What happened?\n\nWe took our pills today. But don’t worry, we’re not going to put Mani up on a pedestal and set up velvet rope barriers and only allow tedious obsessives to listen to it. Mani is still all about having fun with your music. Because if you aren’t having fun with your system, your system is having fun with you!\n\nWhat the hell is a Mani?\n\nIt means “peanut butter” in Spanish. But, more seriously, Mani is the personification of the moon in Norse mythology. And the moon is round. And records are round. And the night is black. And records are black. Yeah, we’re kinda simple around here. But we do make some decent electronics.\n\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n2 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Schiit Mani comes with a 2 year warranty from Schiit that covers manufacturing defects. All products featured on Headphone Zone are backed by an original manufacturer's warranty. Read more about Schiit's warranty in India.\n\n\"The Mani's sound was big and smooth, I heard a minimum of groove noises, clicks, and pops on my LPs.\"\nRead More\n\n\"The Mani always gave me pleasure, because I felt it was delivering nearly everything the grooves had to offer. It danced and sang and offered high praise to the goddesses Edith, Nina, and Janis\".\nRead More",

Schiit Gungnir\n\n2. Power cord\n\nFAQs\n\nWait a whole entire second there, buddy! Are you saying that this has the same insane digital filter and multibit architecture as the Yggdrasil?\n\nIn the case of Gungnir Multibit, yes.\n\nBut…but how can you do Gungnir Multibit at half the price of Yggdrasil?\n\nIt actually only costs $1.83 to make an Yggdrasil and $1.24 to make a Gungnir Multibit, so we’re laughing all the way to the bank!\n\nYou gotta be kidding!\n\nOf course we are. You didn’t think we could be serious for long, did you?\n\nSo what’s the real answer? How is Gungnir Multibit half the price of Yggdrasil?\n\nEasy. It’s a simpler DAC. The power supply has no choke-input, shunt-regulated stage like in Yggdrasil, the chassis and construction more streamlined, we’re using more surface-mount parts in the analog section, and (most importantly), we’re using 18-bit AD5781BRUZ D/A converters, rather than the mind-blowingly expensive AD5791s we use in Yggdrasil. However, the completely insane, closed-form, DSP-based, 18,000-tap filter remains in Gungnir Uber.\n\nHow does Gungnir Multibit sound compared to Yggdrasil?\n\nYou tell us. We think it sounds very, very fine. But we aren’t you.\n\nHow does Gungnir Multibit sound compared to (insert DAC name here)?\n\nCome on, guys, you know we don’t speculate on comparisons to other gear. Have a listen and buy what you like.\n\nWell, then, how does Gungnir sound compared to Gungnir Multibit?\n\nOkay. We see where this is going. Let’s end it here. Both Gungnir and Gungnir Multibit offer formidable performance for the price. Gungnir has been lauded by the press and industry pundits as one of the finest-sounding DACs at its price and is frequently compared to products that cost much more than it does. Gungnir Multibit brings class-leading Yggdrasil multibit performance to a more affordable price point.\n\nAre both Gungnir Multibit and Gungnir true balanced DACs?\n\nYes. Both have true hardware balancing and summed single-ended outputs. They also have our exclusive Adapticlock™ clock regeneration system.\n\nAh schiit, more marketing buzzwords. What’s Adapticlock?\n\nNontechnically, it’s a way to decrapify the inputs, no matter how craptastic they are. If they are not very crappy, they get maximum decrapification, but even if they’re crappy, they get some decrapification.\n\nNow you’re screwing with me!\n\nJust a little. Technically, Adapticlock is the industry’s most advanced jitter-reducing reclocking system. It automatically switches between VCXO and VCO reclocking, depending on the quality of your source. High-quality sources run on the VCXOs, for best jitter performance. Lower-quality sources that deviate from the range of the VCXOs are routed automatically to the VCOs, and an LED on the front panel comes on. We call this the “buy better gear” light.\n\nWhat are some typical high-quality and low-quality sources?\n\nHigh-quality: good CD transports, good DVD/Blu-Ray players, good music servers, most computers. Low-quality: Airport Expresses, satellite receivers, old CD/DVD players.\n\nLet’s move on. What’s Unison USB?\n\nUnison USB is our own proprietary USB input, not based on C-Media or XMOS or any other off-the-shelf USB receiver out there. Instead, we spent a couple of person-years developing our own code for a standard Microchip PIC32 microprocessor, which allowed us to create a higher-performing USB input than anything else on the market.\n\nBut, USB inputs, like, kinda suck.\n\nNot Unison USB. Even Mike Moffat, the famous “friends don’t let friends use USB” guy, prefers Unison to SPDIF.\n\nSo why is Unison USB so special?\n\nUnison USB is special because it was developed for a single purpose: to provide the highest performance input for PCM digital, period. It doesn’t have ten thousand un-used functions, nor is it trying to optimize for five different unicorn formats that will probably be gone tomorrow. It also uses very high-quality local clocks and offers complete electrostatic and electromagnetic isolation from the source. It also provides lower power draw and complete UAC2 compatibility.\n\nSo what platforms does your Unison USB input support?\n\nActually, the question should be “What platforms support your Unison USB input?” since our Unison USB input is 100% UAC2 compliant (that is, USB Audio Class 2, the accepted standard for USB audio transmission.) So, here you go:\nLinux. As in, most popular streamers, from the Sonore MicroRendu to the Salk Streamer. Note “most.” Also, most Linux distros that support UAC2 natively will be plug and play. Please note that we cannot provide detailed technical support for Linux.\nWindows 10. Yes, Windows 10 only. We don’t provide UAC2 drivers for earlier versions of Windows, sorry. Yes, it is time to step into the present (not the future, Windows 10 has been out for a couple of years now.) Yes, it is time to upgrade. Yes, it’s worth it. Windows 10 is actually a very nice platform.\nMac OSX. From 10.10 on up, Macs are good to go. Sometimes you’ll run into power management problems that will require you to turn off App Nap. Got an older version of macOS? See the comments on Windows above. Time to upgrade. The software is free.\niOS. From iOS7 on up, iOS devices work with USB Camera Connection Kit, Lightning to USB Camera Adapter, a Lightning to USB3 Camera Adapter, or directly with the new USB-C models.\nAndroid. Most Android devices that shipped with Android M or above will work using a USB OTG cable. Some may require separate player software, like USB Audio Player Pro.\n\nHey, I have a Gungnir already! Can it be upgraded to Gungnir Multibit?\n\nYes, it can! See the Upgrades section of the site. You can also upgrade to Unison USB if you'd like.\n\nAnd both Gungnir Multibit and Gungnir are still upgradable?\n\nYep! They’re completely modular. Both the DAC/Analog modules and the USB input module are swappable, when we announce meaningful upgrades.\n\nI heard that this multibit stuff is a bunch of hoo-ha designed to separate me from my money.\n\nCool. Then get Gungnir and save $400. Or keep using the delta-sigma DAC in your phone and save tons more!\n\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n5 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Schiit Gungnir comes with a 5 year warranty from Schiit that covers manufacturing defects.

With the Schiit Gungnir, enjoy a rock-solid and glitch-free connectivity thanks to the Adapticlock™ system. It analyses the quality of the incoming signal and routes it to either a VCXO or VCO-based clock regeneration system, depending on which is the best at the moment. This gives you exceptional jitter performance without any changes in the sample rate or bit depth of the original music.\n\nCHOOSE BETWEEN DELTA-SIGMA OR SCHIIT'S TRUE MULTI-BIT ARCHITECTURE\n\nYou get to pick between two options — an affordable Delta-Sigma option that offers excellent performance at a moderate price. The second is Schitt's very own True Multi-Bit Architecture which includes the same proprietary DSP-based digital filter, discrete JFET buffers and summers that are also used in the Yggdrasil. 4 precision Analog Devices AD5781BRUZ DACs for true hardware balancing and 19 effective bits of resolution are also present. Both variants use Schiit's Unison USB that includes a PIC32 microprocessor, complete electrostatic & electromagnetic isolation as well as precision local clocks. This ensures a lower power draw and better performance.\n\nSPECS\n\nGUNGNIR\n\nD/A CONVERSION IC\nAKM AK4399 x 2 (4 total channels, hardware balanced configuration)\n\nANALOG STAGES\nAll fully discrete, JFET-input topology, DC coupled, summed for single-ended output\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE, ANALOG STAGE\n20Hz-20Khz, +/-0.1dB, 1Hz-100KHz, -1dB\n\nMAXIMUM OUTPUT\n4.0V RMS (balanced) 2.0V RMS (single-ended)\n\nTHD\nLess than 0.002%, 20Hz-20KHz, at full output\n\nIMD\n<0.002%, CCIR\n\nSNR\n112dB, referenced to 2V RMS\n\nGUNGNIR MULTIBIT Multibit\n\nD/A CONVERSION IC\nAnalog Devices AD5781BRUZ x 4 (2 per channel, hardware balanced configuration)\n\nDIGITAL FILTERS\nproprietary Schiit bitperfect closed-form digital filter implemented on Analog Devices SHARC DSP processor\n\nANALOG STAGES\nFully discrete JFET buffers for balanced output and discrete JFET summing stages for single-ended output, direct coupled throughout\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE, ANALOG STAGE\n20Hz-20Khz, +/-0.1dB, 1Hz-200KHz, -1dB\n\nMAXIMUM OUTPUT\n4.0V RMS (balanced), 2.0V RMS (single-ended)\n\nTHD\nLess than 0.005%, 20Hz-20KHz, at full output\n\nIMD\n<0.004%, CCIR\n\nSNR\n115dB, referenced to 2V RMS\n\nALL GUNGNIR\n\nINPUTS\nCoaxial RCA SPDIF, BNC SPDIF, Optical SPDIF, USB\n\nINPUT CAPABILITY\nup to 24/192 for all inputs\n\nINPUT RECEIVER, SPDIF\nAKM 4113\n\nINPUT RECEIVER, USB\nSchiit Unison USB™, based on Microchip PIC32 microprocessor\n\nOUTPUT\nOne pair XLR balanced and two pairs RCA single-ended\n\nOUTPUT IMPEDANCE\n75 ohms\n\nCLOCK MANAGEMENT\nBitperfect clock management at all native sample rates via Adapticlock analysis and VCXO/VCO regeneration\n\nPOWER SUPPLY\ntwo transformers (one for digital supplies, one for analog supplies) with 8 stages of regulation, including separate local supplies for critical digital and analog sections\n\nUPGRADABILITY\nSeparate, modular USB Input Card and DAC/Analog Cards are snap-in replaceable\n\nPOWER CONSUMPTION\n20W\n\nSIZE\n16 x 8.75” x 2.25”\n\nWEIGHT\n11 lbs\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1. Schiit Gungnir\n\n2. Power cord\n\nFAQs\n\nWait a whole entire second there, buddy! Are you saying that this has the same insane digital filter and multibit architecture as the Yggdrasil?\n\nIn the case of Gungnir Multibit, yes.\n\nBut…but how can you do Gungnir Multibit at half the price of Yggdrasil?\n\nIt actually only costs $1.83 to make an Yggdrasil and $1.24 to make a Gungnir Multibit, so we’re laughing all the way to the bank!\n\nYou gotta be kidding!\n\nOf course we are. You didn’t think we could be serious for long, did you?\n\nSo what’s the real answer? How is Gungnir Multibit half the price of Yggdrasil?\n\nEasy. It’s a simpler DAC. The power supply has no choke-input, shunt-regulated stage like in Yggdrasil, the chassis and construction more streamlined, we’re using more surface-mount parts in the analog section, and (most importantly), we’re using 18-bit AD5781BRUZ D/A converters, rather than the mind-blowingly expensive AD5791s we use in Yggdrasil. However, the completely insane, closed-form, DSP-based, 18,000-tap filter remains in Gungnir Uber.\n\nHow does Gungnir Multibit sound compared to Yggdrasil?\n\nYou tell us. We think it sounds very, very fine. But we aren’t you.\n\nHow does Gungnir Multibit sound compared to (insert DAC name here)?\n\nCome on, guys, you know we don’t speculate on comparisons to other gear. Have a listen and buy what you like.\n\nWell, then, how does Gungnir sound compared to Gungnir Multibit?\n\nOkay. We see where this is going. Let’s end it here. Both Gungnir and Gungnir Multibit offer formidable performance for the price. Gungnir has been lauded by the press and industry pundits as one of the finest-sounding DACs at its price and is frequently compared to products that cost much more than it does. Gungnir Multibit brings class-leading Yggdrasil multibit performance to a more affordable price point.\n\nAre both Gungnir Multibit and Gungnir true balanced DACs?\n\nYes. Both have true hardware balancing and summed single-ended outputs. They also have our exclusive Adapticlock™ clock regeneration system.\n\nAh schiit, more marketing buzzwords. What’s Adapticlock?\n\nNontechnically, it’s a way to decrapify the inputs, no matter how craptastic they are. If they are not very crappy, they get maximum decrapification, but even if they’re crappy, they get some decrapification.\n\nNow you’re screwing with me!\n\nJust a little. Technically, Adapticlock is the industry’s most advanced jitter-reducing reclocking system. It automatically switches between VCXO and VCO reclocking, depending on the quality of your source. High-quality sources run on the VCXOs, for best jitter performance. Lower-quality sources that deviate from the range of the VCXOs are routed automatically to the VCOs, and an LED on the front panel comes on. We call this the “buy better gear” light.\n\nWhat are some typical high-quality and low-quality sources?\n\nHigh-quality: good CD transports, good DVD/Blu-Ray players, good music servers, most computers. Low-quality: Airport Expresses, satellite receivers, old CD/DVD players.\n\nLet’s move on. What’s Unison USB?\n\nUnison USB is our own proprietary USB input, not based on C-Media or XMOS or any other off-the-shelf USB receiver out there. Instead, we spent a couple of person-years developing our own code for a standard Microchip PIC32 microprocessor, which allowed us to create a higher-performing USB input than anything else on the market.\n\nBut, USB inputs, like, kinda suck.\n\nNot Unison USB. Even Mike Moffat, the famous “friends don’t let friends use USB” guy, prefers Unison to SPDIF.\n\nSo why is Unison USB so special?\n\nUnison USB is special because it was developed for a single purpose: to provide the highest performance input for PCM digital, period. It doesn’t have ten thousand un-used functions, nor is it trying to optimize for five different unicorn formats that will probably be gone tomorrow. It also uses very high-quality local clocks and offers complete electrostatic and electromagnetic isolation from the source. It also provides lower power draw and complete UAC2 compatibility.\n\nSo what platforms does your Unison USB input support?\n\nActually, the question should be “What platforms support your Unison USB input?” since our Unison USB input is 100% UAC2 compliant (that is, USB Audio Class 2, the accepted standard for USB audio transmission.) So, here you go:\nLinux. As in, most popular streamers, from the Sonore MicroRendu to the Salk Streamer. Note “most.” Also, most Linux distros that support UAC2 natively will be plug and play. Please note that we cannot provide detailed technical support for Linux.\nWindows 10. Yes, Windows 10 only. We don’t provide UAC2 drivers for earlier versions of Windows, sorry. Yes, it is time to step into the present (not the future, Windows 10 has been out for a couple of years now.) Yes, it is time to upgrade. Yes, it’s worth it. Windows 10 is actually a very nice platform.\nMac OSX. From 10.10 on up, Macs are good to go. Sometimes you’ll run into power management problems that will require you to turn off App Nap. Got an older version of macOS? See the comments on Windows above. Time to upgrade. The software is free.\niOS. From iOS7 on up, iOS devices work with USB Camera Connection Kit, Lightning to USB Camera Adapter, a Lightning to USB3 Camera Adapter, or directly with the new USB-C models.\nAndroid. Most Android devices that shipped with Android M or above will work using a USB OTG cable. Some may require separate player software, like USB Audio Player Pro.\n\nHey, I have a Gungnir already! Can it be upgraded to Gungnir Multibit?\n\nYes, it can! See the Upgrades section of the site. You can also upgrade to Unison USB if you'd like.\n\nAnd both Gungnir Multibit and Gungnir are still upgradable?\n\nYep! They’re completely modular. Both the DAC/Analog modules and the USB input module are swappable, when we announce meaningful upgrades.\n\nI heard that this multibit stuff is a bunch of hoo-ha designed to separate me from my money.\n\nCool. Then get Gungnir and save $400. Or keep using the delta-sigma DAC in your phone and save tons more!\n\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n5 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Schiit Gungnir comes with a 5 year warranty from Schiit that covers manufacturing defects.

A gain of 1 is perfect for sensitive IEMs while a standard gain of 8 can drive even power-hungry headphones. The Mjolnir 2 also offers balanced and single-ended outputs for headphones & preamps. It uses Schiit's proprietary, inherently balanced and differential Crossfet topology. With a custom 4-gang RK27 Alps volume pot and balanced in/ balanced out, you get superior performance.\n\nPICK BETWEEN TUBE, SOLID-STATE OR BOTH!\n\nYou can get the Mjolnir 2 as a tube hybrid, or as a pure solid-state amp — or get both, and switch between the two whenever you'd like. You can also swap the standard 6BZ7 tubes for anything in the 6DJ8, 6922, ECC88, and 2492 families, to “roll” the sound according to your specific taste.

Schiit Mjolnir 2\n\n2. Power cord\n\nFAQs\n\nHoly moly, Mjolnir 2 is now a tube amp? The previous one was solid-state. Are you manic-depressive or passive-aggressive or just indecisive?\n\nNo. We really, really like tube hybrid amps, because they provide the best possible combination of the strengths of tubes and the strengths of solid-state. So, we decided to make this unique, circlotron-topology headphone amp with tube gain and MOSFET output\n\nOkay. Let’s move on to the single-ended outputs. I thought you said Mjolnir couldn’t have single-ended outputs! What gives?\n\nA circlotron has no inherent single-ended output. However, the circlotron outputs can be summed together, which is what we did here. Just like Ragnarok. Except lots cheaper. Shoot us for making Mjolnir 2 more flexible.\n\nDo the single-ended outputs put out as much power as the balanced outputs?\n\nNo. They’re limited to about 2W into 32 ohms. Which is still plenty for most headphones.\n\nAre you saying you also finally put some switches on the front of this thing for input switching and gain? I’ve been asking for that, for, like, forever.\n\nYep. Repeat after me: development improves the breed.\n\nHey, this thing runs warm!\n\nYep, just like Asgard 2.\n\nSo, is this really a balanced amp, or a fake balanced amp, or what?\n\nHey, don’t blame us for other manufacturers' abuse of terminology. When we say “balanced, differential,” that’s exactly what we mean. There’s no side-whispering going on about “Well, yeah, after we convert it to single-ended, then back to balanced again.”\n\nWhat the hell is a Circlotron, and why do I need it?\n\n“Circlotron” was the first commercial name for a cross-shunt push-pull output stage. At the time, it used tubes. We use MOSFET outputs, so we call our topology Crossfet™.\n\nCrossfet™? Are the FETs angry?\n\nNo. They’re thrilled. N-channel MOSFETs and P-channel MOSFETs usually don’t match too well (and that’s putting it mildly.) Crossfet allows us to use only N-Channel MOSFETs, for better matching, and for an elegantly simple output stage with great performance.\n\nWarranty & MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n5 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Schiit Mjolnir 2 comes with a 5 year warranty from Schiit that covers manufacturing defects.

The Schiit Valhalla 2 isn't that. It can be used with sensitive, lower-impedance headphones as well. You can use it with Grados, AKGs and various IEMs. You may even like it with high-efficiency planars like the LCD-X, LCD-XC, Oppo PM-1 and HE-400.\n\nNOT YOUR AVERAGE TUBE AMP\n\nAdd some \"tube magic\" to your powered monitors with the Valhalla 2's preamp outs. You can match your headphone's output and impedance to this amplifier easily with the gain switch. Spoiler Alert: The Valhalla 2 is exceptionally accurate, resolving and neutral. It does not have that syrupy, pleasing coloured tube sound.\n\nSPECS\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n20Hz-20Khz, -0.1db, 7Hz-200KHz, -3dB\n\nMAXIMUM POWER\n300mW RMS per channel at less than 10% THD (300 ohms) 340mW RMS per channel at less than 10% THD (600 ohms)\n\nTHD\n< 0.02%, 20Hz-20KHz, at 1V RMS, low gain, 600 ohms\n\nIMD\n< 0.03%, CCIF at 1V RMS low gain, 600 ohms\n\nSNR\n98db, unweighted, referenced to 1V RMS, low gain\n\nCROSSTALK\n< -71dB, 20 Hz-20KHz\n\nOUTPUT IMPEDANCE\n14 ohms (hi gain), 3.5 ohms (lo gain)\n\nINPUT IMPEDANCE\n100K ohms\n\nGAIN\n7 (16.9db) or 1.5 (3.5 db), via rear switch\n\nTOPOLOGY\nAll-triode, noninverting, single voltage gain stage, current source biased front end and optimized WCF output stage, DC-coupled input\n\nTUBE COMPLEMENT\n6N1P dual triode input, 6N6P dual triode output, 1 each per channel. 6N1Ps rollable to 6DJ8, E88CC, 6922, 6BZ7, and similar types.\n\nPOWER SUPPLY\nTwo internal power transformers with over 2,000uF of filter capacitance\n\nPOWER CONSUMPTION\n40W\n\nSIZE\n9 x 6 x 3.25”\n\nWEIGHT\n3.17kg (7 lbs)\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1. Schiit Valhalla 2\n\n2. Power cord\n\n3. Stick-on feet\n\nFAQs\n\nWait, wait, wait. low impedance headphones on an OTL tube amp? Are you nuts?\n\nNo, not completely. At typical listening levels, with high efficiency headphones, the low output impedance and higher current capability of Valhalla 2 mean you might be surprised by the sound.\n\nWhat makes Valhalla 2 different than most tube amps?\n\nWe infuse each of the electrons in Valhalla with special powertrode ions, which gives the output super-strength. Each milli-amp of current in Valhalla is actually worth many amps of current in other amps.\n\nAre you done now? Want to give us a real answer about how you made Valhalla 2 the “super OTL” amp?\n\nOkay, fine, we’ll take our pills. Ahem. There’s really no magic. We just spent a long time optimizing both the input and output topology to maximize current delivery, and to reduce output impedance. This entailed quite a few tweaks to the common-cathode front end, adding a new negative voltage rail and current source to up the overall gain, and also changes to the White cathode follower output.\n\nHey, you’re making that up, too!\n\nNo, actually, we aren’t. To really understand our serious answers, you’ll need to learn engineerese, I’m afraid.\n\nSo what does that mean?\n\nIn simpler numbers: 2-8x lower output impedance, 8x lower distortion, 2x more current delivery, and lower noise. In simpler terms: while Valhalla was marginal-to-bad with IEMs and low-impedance headphones, Valhalla 2 is better. It’s not the be-all and end-all, but it’s now a much more well-rounded amp.\n\nWhat headphones are Valhalla really good for?\n\nValhalla is still going to be at its best with high-impedance headphones like the 300 ohm Sennheisers and 250-600 ohm Beyers. With up to 60V p-p output capability, it can light up high-impedance headphones.\n\nDoes the volume control adjust the preamp outputs?\n\nYes.\n\nCan I turn off the headphone outs when I’m using the preamp outputs?\n\nThe preamp outputs are automatically turned off when you plug in your headphones. Unplug your headphones to use the pre outs.\n\nHow do I switch the gain?\n\nThere’s a toggle switch on the back of the amp.\n\nIs Valhalla rollable?\n\nYes! The standard 6N1P input tubes can be subbed out for any 6DJ8/6922/ECC88/ECC85/6BZ7 types, including NOS, cryo-treated, voodoo-blessed, hand-assembled by elves, etc.\n\nDoes this have a muting relay, like all your other amps?\n\nNo. The slow turn-on and turn-off characteristics of tubes and limited current capability means there's no muting relay—which is the same for pretty much every tube OTL headphone amp out there.

The Schiit Valhalla 2 isn't that. It can be used with sensitive, lower-impedance headphones as well. You can use it with Grados, AKGs and various IEMs. You may even like it with high-efficiency planars like the LCD-X, LCD-XC, Oppo PM-1 and HE-400.\n\nNOT YOUR AVERAGE TUBE AMP\n\nAdd some \"tube magic\" to your powered monitors with the Valhalla 2's preamp outs. You can match your headphone's output and impedance to this amplifier easily with the gain switch. Spoiler Alert: The Valhalla 2 is exceptionally accurate, resolving and neutral. It does not have that syrupy, pleasing coloured tube sound.\n\nSPECS\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n20Hz-20Khz, -0.1db, 7Hz-200KHz, -3dB\n\nMAXIMUM POWER\n300mW RMS per channel at less than 10% THD (300 ohms) 340mW RMS per channel at less than 10% THD (600 ohms)\n\nTHD\n< 0.02%, 20Hz-20KHz, at 1V RMS, low gain, 600 ohms\n\nIMD\n< 0.03%, CCIF at 1V RMS low gain, 600 ohms\n\nSNR\n98db, unweighted, referenced to 1V RMS, low gain\n\nCROSSTALK\n< -71dB, 20 Hz-20KHz\n\nOUTPUT IMPEDANCE\n14 ohms (hi gain), 3.5 ohms (lo gain)\n\nINPUT IMPEDANCE\n100K ohms\n\nGAIN\n7 (16.9db) or 1.5 (3.5 db), via rear switch\n\nTOPOLOGY\nAll-triode, noninverting, single voltage gain stage, current source biased front end and optimized WCF output stage, DC-coupled input\n\nTUBE COMPLEMENT\n6N1P dual triode input, 6N6P dual triode output, 1 each per channel. 6N1Ps rollable to 6DJ8, E88CC, 6922, 6BZ7, and similar types.\n\nPOWER SUPPLY\nTwo internal power transformers with over 2,000uF of filter capacitance\n\nPOWER CONSUMPTION\n40W\n\nSIZE\n9 x 6 x 3.25”\n\nWEIGHT\n3.17kg (7 lbs)\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1. Schiit Valhalla 2\n\n2. Power cord\n\n3. Stick-on feet\n\nFAQs\n\nWait, wait, wait. low impedance headphones on an OTL tube amp? Are you nuts?\n\nNo, not completely. At typical listening levels, with high efficiency headphones, the low output impedance and higher current capability of Valhalla 2 mean you might be surprised by the sound.\n\nWhat makes Valhalla 2 different than most tube amps?\n\nWe infuse each of the electrons in Valhalla with special powertrode ions, which gives the output super-strength. Each milli-amp of current in Valhalla is actually worth many amps of current in other amps.\n\nAre you done now? Want to give us a real answer about how you made Valhalla 2 the “super OTL” amp?\n\nOkay, fine, we’ll take our pills. Ahem. There’s really no magic. We just spent a long time optimizing both the input and output topology to maximize current delivery, and to reduce output impedance. This entailed quite a few tweaks to the common-cathode front end, adding a new negative voltage rail and current source to up the overall gain, and also changes to the White cathode follower output.\n\nHey, you’re making that up, too!\n\nNo, actually, we aren’t. To really understand our serious answers, you’ll need to learn engineerese, I’m afraid.\n\nSo what does that mean?\n\nIn simpler numbers: 2-8x lower output impedance, 8x lower distortion, 2x more current delivery, and lower noise. In simpler terms: while Valhalla was marginal-to-bad with IEMs and low-impedance headphones, Valhalla 2 is better. It’s not the be-all and end-all, but it’s now a much more well-rounded amp.\n\nWhat headphones are Valhalla really good for?\n\nValhalla is still going to be at its best with high-impedance headphones like the 300 ohm Sennheisers and 250-600 ohm Beyers. With up to 60V p-p output capability, it can light up high-impedance headphones.\n\nDoes the volume control adjust the preamp outputs?\n\nYes.\n\nCan I turn off the headphone outs when I’m using the preamp outputs?\n\nThe preamp outputs are automatically turned off when you plug in your headphones. Unplug your headphones to use the pre outs.\n\nHow do I switch the gain?\n\nThere’s a toggle switch on the back of the amp.\n\nIs Valhalla rollable?\n\nYes! The standard 6N1P input tubes can be subbed out for any 6DJ8/6922/ECC88/ECC85/6BZ7 types, including NOS, cryo-treated, voodoo-blessed, hand-assembled by elves, etc.\n\nDoes this have a muting relay, like all your other amps?\n\nNo. The slow turn-on and turn-off characteristics of tubes and limited current capability means there's no muting relay—which is the same for pretty much every tube OTL headphone amp out there. While there is DC on the output at turn-on and turn-off, it is on the order of 100mV into 32-ohm headphones. If you are concerned about this, unplug your headphones before turning the amp off, and wait 30 seconds or so after you turn Valhalla 2 on to plug in.\n\nI was told that tube amps are all about euphonic distortion and that you’re a bunch of crazy money-grubbing arseholes because you make tube amps.\n\nHave you ever heard a tube amp?\n\nNo, seriously.\n\nWe are serious. Have you ever heard a tube amp?\n\nNo, I don’t find it necessary, having done the calculations for exact current and voltage delivery to my headphones to achieve a long-term safe listening level, and knowing the distortion floor of my particular transducers—\n\nOkay, we see where this is going. Bottom line, we make both highly-capable, completely-neutral-by-the-measurements, inexpensive solid state amps, and wacky tube and tube hybrid amps. Why? Because some people like solid state, and some people like tubes. You know, like some people like Camrys and some like Corvettes. Like some people like Budweiser, and some people like Bordeaux. Amazing thing, the world, full of so many different experiences and so many different opinions of them. Is one right, and another wrong? If so, who is the arbiter? Bottom line, if you don’t agree with our approach, there are tons of other options out there. Have fun, and we hope you find one that fits your desires perfectly.\n\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n5 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Schiit Valhalla 2 comes with a 5 year warranty from Schiit that covers manufacturing defects.

Rahman, Michael Jackson, and the Eagles.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nA HEADPHONE AS UNIQUE AND AWESOME AS YOU!\n\nExperience pure luxury in terms of looks and sound with the Meze 99 Classics. This headphone has been lovingly handcrafted from wood and the satin-finished wood grain makes each headphone unique, just like your fingerprint. With these, Meze has worked to change the perception of headphones from being seen as technical devices or cheap plastic accessories to a mature product that you'll fall in love with.\n\nA RICH NATURAL SOUND\n\nEnjoy a crisp, balanced sound with the Meze 99 Classics. The 40mm neodymium drivers offer a clear, undistorted sound. Just sit back and put these on to enjoy the gorgeous sound of plucked strings, upbeat grooves or thumping beats that's natural and lifelike. In addition, the snug medium density memory foam keeps away noise while offering superior noise isolation.\n\nHIGH-QUALITY AND LUXURY IN EVERY ELEMENT\n\nApart from wood, the 99 Classics also use cast zinc and manganese spring steel. The headband ensures even pressure for long listening sessions. The headpad and earpads are made from PU leather. Everything is then put together using nuts and bolts. This makes the headphone fully serviceable. The entire headphone is made from only premium materials, no glue or plastic.\n\nMADE WITH CARE USING AN EXTENSIVE PROCESS\n\nEach Meze 99 Classics takes almost 45 days to be made. The wood used is harvested from mature trees that have reached the end of their life cycle. This ensures that there is no harm done to the environment while giving you that rich, natural sound. To further enhance the colours, the wood goes through extensive air drying and shaping by hand and CNC machines, a process that takes almost 8 hours. It then goes through sanding, lacquering, finishing, careful inspection and is finally assembled.\n\nSpecs\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVERS\n40mm\n\nIMPEDANCE\n32Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n103dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n15Hz - 25,000Hz\n\nRATED INPUT POWER\n30mW\n\nMAXIMUM INPUT POWER\n50mW\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTION\n3.5mm\n\nMICROPHONE\nYes\n\nREMOTE\n1-Button\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n260g\n\nGRILL\nClosed Back\n\nEAR-CUPS\nWalnut Wood\n\nCABLE\nKevlar OFC cable\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

I would listen to every genre track on them. It's gorgeous to look at, and sounds better than anything else in the segment. They're timeliness. I hope to hand them to my kids someday.\n\nRAGHAV SOMANI\nHeadphone Guru\n\nAbout Raghav Somani\nRaghav Somani is the Founder & CEO of Headphone Zone. An avid audiophile and musician since 2008, his choice of headphones include STAX Electrostats, Audeze LCD 3, and for music on the go, the JH Audio Roxanne + Astell&Kern SP1000 is never too far away. On his playlist, you'll find A.R. Rahman, Michael Jackson, and the Eagles.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nA HEADPHONE AS UNIQUE AND AWESOME AS YOU!\n\nExperience pure luxury in terms of looks and sound with the Meze 99 Classics. This headphone has been lovingly handcrafted from wood and the satin-finished wood grain makes each headphone unique, just like your fingerprint. With these, Meze has worked to change the perception of headphones from being seen as technical devices or cheap plastic accessories to a mature product that you'll fall in love with.\n\nA RICH NATURAL SOUND\n\nEnjoy a crisp, balanced sound with the Meze 99 Classics. The 40mm neodymium drivers offer a clear, undistorted sound. Just sit back and put these on to enjoy the gorgeous sound of plucked strings, upbeat grooves or thumping beats that's natural and lifelike. In addition, the snug medium density memory foam keeps away noise while offering superior noise isolation.\n\nHIGH-QUALITY AND LUXURY IN EVERY ELEMENT\n\nApart from wood, the 99 Classics also use cast zinc and manganese spring steel. The headband ensures even pressure for long listening sessions. The headpad and earpads are made from PU leather. Everything is then put together using nuts and bolts. This makes the headphone fully serviceable. The entire headphone is made from only premium materials, no glue or plastic.\n\nMADE WITH CARE USING AN EXTENSIVE PROCESS\n\nEach Meze 99 Classics takes almost 45 days to be made. The wood used is harvested from mature trees that have reached the end of their life cycle. This ensures that there is no harm done to the environment while giving you that rich, natural sound. To further enhance the colours, the wood goes through extensive air drying and shaping by hand and CNC machines, a process that takes almost 8 hours. It then goes through sanding, lacquering, finishing, careful inspection and is finally assembled.\n\nSpecs\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVERS\n40mm\n\nIMPEDANCE\n32Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n103dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n15Hz - 25,000Hz\n\nRATED INPUT POWER\n30mW\n\nMAXIMUM INPUT POWER\n50mW\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTION\n3.5mm\n\nMICROPHONE\nYes\n\nREMOTE\n1-Button\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n260g\n\nGRILL\nClosed Back\n\nEAR-CUPS\nWalnut Wood\n\nCABLE\nKevlar OFC cable\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

Not the Schiit Vali 2. It uses a unique, class-leading power supply that gives you 60V on the plate. Along with a fully discrete, current-mode noninverting hybrid topology, this amp redefines what you can expect from an affordable tube amp, even at twice its price.\n\nTHE POWER TO ROLL YOUR OWN SOUND\n\nThe Vali 2 comes with a single NOS 6BZ7 tube, which can be swapped for other Schitt tubes to “roll” the sound to your own preference. It delivers 1W into 32 ohms for hard-to-drive headphones—while providing a low gain mode for low-noise performance with sensitive headphones. You can also use the preamp outputs to add a tube preamp to your power amp or powered monitors.\n\nSPECS\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n20Hz-20Khz, -0.2db 5Hz-150KHz, -3dB\n\nMAXIMUM POWER\n1300mW RMS per channel (16 ohms) 1000mW RMS per channel (32 ohms) 650mW RMS per channel (50 ohms) 270mW RMS per channel (300 ohms) 270mW RMS per channel (600 ohms)\n\nTHD\n<0.03%, 20Hz-20KHz, at 1V RMS, low gain\n\nIMD\n<0.05%, CCIR, low gain\n\nSNR\n99db, unweighted, referenced to 1V RMS, low gain\n\nCROSSTALK\n-68dB, 20Hz-20KHz\n\nOUTPUT IMPEDANCE\n1.2 ohms in low gain mode, 5.8 ohms in high gain mode\n\nINPUT IMPEDANCE\n50K ohms\n\nGAIN\n5 (14dB) or 1.25 (2dB)\n\nTOPOLOGY\nTube voltage gain with convolved bipolar current mode inverter and discrete bipolar class AB output stage\n\nPROTECTION\nDelayed start and fast shut-down with muting relay\n\nPOWER CONSUMPTION\n9W\n\nWEIGHT\n453g (1 lb)\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1. Schiit - Vali 2\n\n2. Wall-Wart\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat? A Vali 2 with preamp outputs! And more power! And a gain switch! And that allows you to roll tubes, like, externally, like a real tube amp? For only $169?\n\nYes, we see you have a good grasp of the particulars of this amp. Congratulations! You probably do very well in school.\n\nAnd this thing is powerful enough for inefficient headphones and quiet enough for IEMs, as in, I can use it with pretty much all of my headphones?\n\nYes. Pretty much. It may not be ideal, say, for HiFiMan HE-6s, which are very, very hard to drive. Beyond that, yep, it’s a great little tube amp that you can use with almost anything.\n\nAnd I can connect those preamp outputs to my powered monitors on my desk?\n\nYep! Or a power amp. It’s a nice little single-input tube hybrid preamp.\n\nHey, I’m new to tubes, how long do they last?\n\nAbout 5,000 hours, give or take. Probably longer in Vali 2, since the tubes are run very conservatively. And…don’t panic. Humans lived for decades with only this electronic technology at their disposal. We even went into space and stuff with it.\n\nAnd when the tube goes bad?\n\nYou replace it. We sell single 6BZ7 tubes, matched to 2%, for $10. But there are a lot of other options out there, including 6DJ8, 6922, ECC88, 2492, and even more. Pretty much any tube with a 6DJ8 pinout, 6V heater, and 600mA or less of heater current will work fine in Vali 2. Beyond that, we don't speculate which tubes are \"best.\"\n\nSo wait, how do you match a single tube?\n\nGood question! The tubes we use are “double triodes,” meaning they have two triodes per tube (how else could a single tube work in a stereo amp?) The two triodes inside each tube have to be matched for gain, or else there may be some channel imbalance. When you order tubes for rolling, make sure both triodes are matched (some tube resellers call them “sections.”)\n\nAh, I said I was new to this tube thing, I don’t want to spend megabucks on getting a dozen different tubes to try!\n\nThat’s fine. The tubes we supply are very nice. Sit back, relax, and enjoy them!\n\nSo you probably cheaped out and left the protection off this amp, or something stupid like that, right?\n\nNo. Vali 2 has a relay mute for delayed startup and fast shut-down. You can leave your headphones plugged in all the time.\n\nSo how can you deliver those high volts? I bet it’s a switching supply!\n\nThink again. Vali 2’s power supply is 100% linear, with regulation on every voltage rail. A unique wall-wart with 2 AC voltages allows us to provide for the needs of the tube heater, the low-voltage rail for the output, and the high-voltage rail for the tube. You may have noticed the funny DIN-plug connector on the amp. Hey, at least you won’t mistake this wall-wart for anything else!\n\nHey, you say \"exceptional thermal efficiency,\" but this thing runs warm!\n\nYes, it does. Welcome to tube amps.\n\nHey, can you use LISST in this?\n\nSure you can, but why? Magni 2 Uber is a better, more powerful, and less expensive choice for a solid-state amp.\n\nI heard that ultimate accuracy is the result of exemplary measurements, including vanishingly low THD, low noise, and low output impedance, so I don’t know how this thing can sound very good.\n\nAre you going to let others think for you, or are you going to listen for yourself?\n\nWhat the hell is Vali?\n\nIn Norse mythology, Vali is the son of Odin and the giantess Rindr. There’s this amazing resource called Wikipedia. You may have heard of it.\n\nI want a combined DAC/amp! Why didn’t you put a DAC in here?\n\nWe did. It’s just in a different chassis and costs another $99 or $249. It’s called “Modi\" or \"Modi Multibit.\" Stack with Vali 2 for a combined tube hybrid DAC/Amp.\n\nWARRANTY & MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n2 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Schiit Vali 2 comes with a 2 year warranty from Schiit that covers manufacturing defects. All products featured on Headphone Zone are backed by an original manufacturer's warranty. Read more about Schiit's warranty in India.\n\n\"To sum this all up, the Schiit Vali 2 is a fun, relatively affordable, little all-arounder. Unpack the box and get great sound, not a lot different than a good solid state amp.\"\nRead More",

The DT 1770 PRO is a closed-back that serves as a reference in the best studios in the world.\n\nRAGHAV SOMANI\nHeadphone Guru\n\nAbout Raghav Somani\nRaghav Somani is the Founder & CEO of Headphone Zone. An avid audiophile and musician since 2008, his choice of headphones include STAX Electrostats, Audeze LCD 3, and for music on the go, the JH Audio Roxanne + Astell&Kern SP1000 is never too far away. On his playlist, you'll find A.R. Rahman, Michael Jackson, and the Eagles.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nBRINGING THE TESLA TO THE STUDIO\n\nTaking the Tesla Technology to a studio reference headphone for mixing, mastering and monitoring: the DT 1770 Pro features a modern and elegant design with components including end pieces, yokes, ear cups and headband that are very durable.\n\nDESIGNED FOR STUDIO PROFESSIONALS AND AUDIO ENGINEERS\n\nThe DT 1770 PRO is a perfect circumaural headphone for high-end studio use of mixing and mastering. Due to its closed design with a high ambient noise attenuation, it is perfect for users in loud environments such as sound engineers when listening to PA systems or musicians.\n\nMAXIMUM PRECISION, MINIMUM LEAKAGE\n\nThe closed-back design offers a wide soundstage and excellent resolution together with a precise, natural bass output making these headphones the top pick for professional studio use. Background noise is effectively suppressed, and leakage minimized thanks to the closed-back design. The DT 1770 Pro walks the fine line between pure flat response and slight boosting in certain frequency ranges to allow for clarity, richness, and depth. The clean highs are balanced with full-bodied, deep bass.\n\n45MM DYNAMIC TESLA DRIVERS\n\nEmploying Beyerdynamic's Tesla 2.0 technology for the first time in professional headphones, the drivers utilize a triple layer composite diaphragm to reduce \"partial oscillations,\" which results in a more detailed audio performance.\n\nRUGGED BUILD AND REPLACEABLE COMPONENTS\n\nThe DT 1770 PRO is very durable. The headband has been constructed from steel and replaceable headband pads that are high on comfort for long listening sessions. All components are replaceable and ensure a long lifetime of the headphone.\n\nTWO PAIRS OF EARPADS, TWO SOUNDS\n\nTwo pairs of ear pads are included in order to achieve the ideal sound characteristic depending on the use case. Velour ear pads provide an open sound and are perfect for mixing and mastering. A pair of leatherette ear pads provide a more closed sound making the headphones more well suited to monitoring applications.\n\nA PLETHORA OF ACCESSORIES\n\nThe headphones come with two detachable cables, one straight and one coiled; a premium protective carry case, two sets of velour & leatherette earpads and two gold-plated ¼-inch headphone jack adapters.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVERS\n45 mm\n\nDRIVER TYPE\nTesla Driver\n\nMAGNET\nNeodymium\n\nIMPEDANCE\n250Ω\n\nSENSITIVITY\n102 dB @ 1 kHz\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n5Hz - 40,000Hz\n\nMAX INPUT POWER\n200 mW\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTION\n3.5mm\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-ear\n\nWEIGHT\n388g\n\nGRILL\nClosed Back\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n\n1.

Premium hard case\n\nFAQS\n\nWhat is the warranty period on the Beyerdynamic - DT 1770 Pro?\n\nThe warranty period on all Beyerdynamic products is 2 years. For more warranty details click here.\n\nHow is the overall sound of Beyerdynamic - DT 1770 Pro?\n\nBeyerdynamic is a German brand that has made its mark as a fine headphone manufacturer and the DT 1770 Pro model gives clean highs along with a deep bass sound.\n\nWill the DT 1770 Pro replace the DT 770 Pro?\n\nYes, the DT 1770 PRO is an advanced version of the DT 770 PRO, made for audio engineers, producers and musicians who need a pair of high-end studio headphones with uncompromising performance in all relevant aspects such as sound, design, comfort, and accessories.\n\nWhich plug is used for the detachable cable of DT 1770 / 1990 Pro?\n\nThis is a three-pin mini-XLR connection, the male part in the left earcup, the female one on the cable. Pressing the small button on the female plug unlocks the connection. The pin assignment is as follows: (3) - left hot, (2) - right hot, (1) - common return. The other end of the cable is equipped with a stereo minijack (1/8\") with a screwable 1/4\" adapter.\n\nWhat's the difference between the DT 770/990 Pro and the DT 1770/1990 Pro?\n\nThe DT 770/990 PRO is made for musicians, sound engineers, producers as well as beginners looking for a reliable, sturdy and affordable pair of headphones as a working device. The DT 1770/1990 PRO was developed for sound engineers, producers, and musicians looking for a pair of high-end studio headphones with uncompromising performance in all relevant aspects such as sound, design, comfort, and accessories.\n\nWhat do \"Impedance\" and \"Ohms\" mean?\n\nImpedance is the so-called alternating-current resistance that headphones have under specific standard conditions. On devices with low output impedance, headphones are the louder, the lower their impedance is. In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Ω, 32 Ω, and 80 Ω are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Ω are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Ω like the T 1.\n\nDoes the Beyerdynamic - DT 1770 PRO come with a mic?\n\nNo, the Beyerdynamic DT 1770 Pro does not come with a mic since it is more of a studio monitoring headphone.\n\nIs the Beyerdynamic - DT 1770 PRO an over the ear or on the ear product?\n\nIt is a closed-back over-the-ear headphone which makes listening to music even better thanks to its natural noise isolation.\n\nHow is the overall fit of Beyerdynamic - DT 1770 PRO?\n\nBeyerdynamic - DT 1770 Pro fits over the ear and comes with plush pads, which make it plenty comfortable for the majority of users.\n\nDoes the Beyerdynamic - DT 1770 PRO have detachable cables?\n\nThe cables are indeed detachable.\n\nDoes the Beyerdynamic - DT 1770 PRO work well and loud enough with mobile phones ?\n\nIt will work, but not well enough to do justice to the product.

    "description": "We conducted a survey and found that over 88% of headphone owners didn't have a dedicated place to keep their expensive headphones. While some resigned to seeing their headphones casually strewn over a desk, a large portion of our study showed that headphones are well hidden away from view, either in a drawer, or packed neatly in their hard cases or packaging.\nThe question was on everyone's mind.\"How do I make my headphones more accessible?\" Headphones are a prized possession and we found that one should take pride in presenting them.\nThat's when we decided to create the elegant Omega Headphone Stand, a handcrafted wooden stand available in three different wooden finishes: Bamboo, Birch and Walnut.\nA Headphone Zone product, we're confident that this stand is definitely going to change the look of your table top.\nHandcrafted Luxury\nThe Omega stand is handcrafted from wood that is sourced from sustainably forested woodland. It is quite heavy to hold and feels durable to the touch.\nShaped like an Omega\nThe conturing shape of the Omega resembles the natural shape of a human head. This means, that one needn't worry about the headphone's structure being altered or degraded over time.\n\nFit for all Headphones\nAll headphones, large or small can enjoy the luxury of this stand. These easily take the weight of all headphones, and also complement most of them.\nRubber Feet for Added Stability\nWe added in 4 rubber feet - 2 below either end of the stand so the stand becomes practically immovable even if placed at the edge of a desk.\nBirch Wood Finish\nBirch wood finishes, often a substitute for maple wood, are a very popular craftwood option for its smooth lines and soft colours. It's very easy on the eyes. We love the wonderful fine and uniform texture.\nWalnut Wood Finish\nThis beautiful dark wood stand is easily one of the most alluring. Typically found in music instruments and super plush furniture, walnut is a popular choice for the architecture with fine taste. They'd complement most headphones.",

Making for easy storage and convenient for whenever you want to replace or upgrade cables.\n\nDoes the Shure - SRH1540 need and amp?\n\nYes, since it has a high impedance that cannot be driven by a smartphone an Amp gives it the extra boost to the sound.\n\nCan I use the Shure - SRH1540 for long hours?\n\nYes, you can use the Shure - SRH1540 for long hours as it comes with fully adjustable premium padded headband with steel frame provides an ergonomic design for hours of listening comfort.\n\nDoes the Shure - SRH1540 come with a carry pouch?\n\nYes, the Shure - SRH1540 does come with a carry pouch in the box.\n\nCan I use the Shure - SRH1440 for long hours?\n\nYes, you can use the Shure - SRH1440 for long hours as it comes with fully adjustable premium padded headband with steel frame provides an ergonomic design for hours of listening comfort.\n\nWhere can I use the Shure - SRH1540?\n\nThe SRH1540 headphones are packed with features that will enhance your mastering and critical listening.\n\nCan the earpads be replaced?\n\nYes, they can be removed and cleaned so you have a clean and comfortable headset everyday.\n\nWhat do “Impedance” and “Ohms” mean?\n\nImpedance is the so-called alternating-current resistance that headphones have under specific standard conditions. On devices with low output impedance, headphones are the louder, the lower their impedance is. In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Ω, 32 Ω, and 80 Ω are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Ω are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Ω.\n\nWARRANTY AND MEDIA REVIEWS\n\n2 Year Warranty\nDon't sweat it, this Shure SRH1540 comes with a 2 year warranty from Shure that covers manufacturing defects.

    "description": "We conducted a survey and found that over 88% of headphone owners didn't have a dedicated place to keep their expensive headphones. While some resigned to seeing their headphones casually strewn over a desk, a large portion of our study showed that headphones are well hidden away from view, either in a drawer, or packed neatly in their hard cases or packaging.\nThe question was on everyone's mind.\"How do I make my headphones more accessible?\" Headphones are a prized possession and we found that one should take pride in presenting them.\nThat's when we decided to create the elegant Omega Headphone Stand, a handcrafted wooden stand available in three different wooden finishes: Bamboo, Birch and Walnut.\nA Headphone Zone product, we're confident that this stand is definitely going to change the look of your table top.\nHandcrafted Luxury\nThe Omega stand is handcrafted from wood that is sourced from sustainably forested woodland. It is quite heavy to hold and feels durable to the touch.\nShaped like an Omega\nThe conturing shape of the Omega resembles the natural shape of a human head. This means, that one needn't worry about the headphone's structure being altered or degraded over time.\n\nFit for all Headphones\nAll headphones, large or small can enjoy the luxury of this stand. These easily take the weight of all headphones, and also complement most of them.\nRubber Feet for Added Stability\nWe added in 4 rubber feet - 2 below either end of the stand so the stand becomes practically immovable even if placed at the edge of a desk.\nBirch Wood Finish\nBirch wood finishes, often a substitute for maple wood, are a very popular craftwood option for its smooth lines and soft colours. It's very easy on the eyes. We love the wonderful fine and uniform texture.\nWalnut Wood Finish\nThis beautiful dark wood stand is easily one of the most alluring. Typically found in music instruments and super plush furniture, walnut is a popular choice for the architecture with fine taste. They'd complement most headphones.",

    "description": "Designed & Made in USA\n\nFlat Sound Signature\n\nIdeal for Audiophiles\n\nIdeal for Indoor Use\n\nFor Studio & Professionals\n\n3 Years Warranty On Driver\n\nOpen-Back Design\n\nPlanar Magnetic Drivers\n\nReplaceable Mini XLR Cables\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nMADE FOR AUDIO PROFESSIONALS\n\nThe LCD-X (Music Creator's Special) is thoroughly engineered and meticulously hand-built using the finest, most luxurious materials combined with cutting-edge planar magnetic technology in California, U.S.A. Audeze made sure that they closely match transducers and even the earpads by leather texture and colour. All the earpads are filled with carefully chosen acoustical foam for the best fit and sound.\n\nEXTENDED FREQUENCIES & LOWER DISTORTION WITH FAZORS\n\nFazors are special acoustical elements positioned on either side of the magnetic structure. They enhance transparency by affecting the sound waves generated by large planar diaphragms. A few of the benefits include extended frequency response, improved high-frequency extension, and lowered distortion, with better imaging.\n\nAUDEZE'S INNOVATIVE PLANAR MAGNETS\n\nAcoustically engineered for accuracy Audeze’s innovative planar magnetic technology delivers a clear and accurate sound that reveals everything on the recording. The LCD-X (Music Creator's Special) has an efficient push-pull magnetic structure that is specially designed and self-closing. This ensures an acoustically transparent music listening experience. The Double-sided Neodymium magnet arrays deliver a uniform driving force across the entire diaphragm for a near-zero distortion.\n\nPROPRIETARY LOTUS DIAPHRAGM FOR A SMOOTH SOUND\n\nAudeze's proprietary Lotus diaphragm has a printed circuit across most of its surface and is capable of handling maximum continuous operating temperatures of over 400° F. This gives the drivers a smooth, resonance-free frequency response, excellent internal damping, edge damping, very low distortion and an extremely fast transient response.\n\nMIX & MASTER ANYWHERE & EVERYWHERE\n\nNot everyone can listen to their headphones in an acoustically treated room. With the Audeze Reveal plugin, you can add custom filter presets to all Audeze flagships. Now, mix and master in virtually any location, be it the studio, your home or even on top of an active volcano.\n\nENGINEERED TO PERFECTION\n\nThe LCD-X (Music Creator's Special) is thoroughly engineered and meticulously hand-built using the finest, most luxurious materials combined with cutting-edge planar magnetic technology in California, U.S.A.

PROFESSIONAL. PERFORMANCE.\n\nThe M-Series ATH-M40x professional monitor headphones are tuned flat for incredibly accurate audio monitoring across an extended frequency range. Now enhance your studio experience with superior sound isolation and swiveling earcups for convenient one-ear monitoring.\n\n40MM DRIVERS WITH RARE EARTH MAGNETS AND COPPER-CLAD ALUMINIUM WIRE VOICE COILS\n\nThe drivers used in the ATH-M40x are 40mm large and custom made drivers with copper-coated aluminum voice coils and rare-earth magnets. They're fine tuned to deliver a superior sonic experience!\n\nHITS THAT SWEET SPOT FOR BASS\n\nThe M40x is tuned flat for incredibly accurate sound monitoring across the entire frequency range spectrum to produce stupendously clear, clean and most of all, balanced. You can distinctly hear bright sounding vocals and instrumentals in a single track - which creates a large sense of scale that’s obviously the exact opposite of cluttered and muddy-sounding audio.\n\nCUTTING-EDGE ENGINEERING AND ROBUST CONSTRUCTION\n\nThe M40x, even though made of plastic, is known for its use of high quality textured matte construction and overall solid durability. The Pro grade material has been used for the ear cups as well as the headband.\n\n90° SWIVELING CLOSED-BACK EARCUPS FOR ONE-EAR MONITORING\n\nThe cups literally contour your ears and place them inside an air-tight enclosure that feels plush and comfortable. There is no pressure being placed against your ears as a roomy interior is provided. Circumaural design contours around the ears for excellent sound isolation in loud environments.\n\nSTRAIGHT AND COILED SINGLE SIDED CABLE OPTIONS\n\nThe M40x includes two cable options: 1.2 m - 3.0 m coiled cable and 3.0 m straight cable. The 3m straight single-side cable is designed to make the headphones convenient for studio tracking, mixing and field recording. They are very convenient in terms of usage and make life simple.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nDRIVERS\n40mm Drivers\n\nIMPEDANCE\n35 Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n98dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n15Hz - 24,000Hz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nNeodymium\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm Input\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nUniversal\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-Ear\n\nCABLE TYPE\n1.2-3m Coiled Cable, 3m DJ Cable\n\nWEIGHT\n240g\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

Its best-in-class accuracy makes it an irreplaceable tool for those requiring the most transparent audio reproduction available. Step into a new world of music, full of rich detail, low-end clarity and overall accuracy.\n\nENJOY EXTENDED FREQUENCIES & LOWER DISTORTION\n\nThe LCD-3 uses Fazors, special acoustical elements positioned on either side of the magnetic structure. They enhance transparency by affecting the sound waves generated by large planar diaphragms. A few of the benefits include extended frequency response, improved high-frequency extension and lowered distortion, with better imaging.\n\nEXPERIENCE AUDEZE'S PROPRIETARY PLANAR MAGNETIC DRIVERS\n\nRather than use standard headphone drivers that operate like miniature woofers or tweeters, the LCD-3 uses a large, 6.17-square-inch thin-film planar magnetic driver that's embedded with Audeze's proprietary Lotus diaphragm that's thinner than a human hair for fast response times. This gives a smooth, resonance-free frequency response, excellent internal damping, edge damping, very low distortion and extremely fast transient response.\n\nMIX & MASTER ANYWHERE & EVERYWHERE\n\nNot everyone can listen to their headphones in an acoustically treated room. With the Audeze Reveal plugin, you can add custom filter presets to all Audeze flagships. Now, mix and master in virtually any location, be it the studio, your home or even on top of an active volcano.\n\nHANDCRAFTED WITH PREMIUM MATERIALS\n\nMade in the USA, the Audeze LCD-3 are handcrafted using high-quality luxurious materials. It features Audeze's tonal balance and powerful bass that beautifully articulates the power and nuance of your favourite music. The gorgeous wooden rings are designed for the audiophile with a discerning ear & style. The real lambskin leather or Microsuede earpads and headband use acoustical foam for the best fit and sound.\n\nSPECS\n\nAUDIO SPECIFICATIONS\n\nMAX INPUT POWER\n15W (for 200ms)\n\nIMPEDANCE\n110 Ohms\n\nSENSITIVITY\n102dB\n\nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\n5Hz – 20kHz extended out to 50kHz\n\nMAGNET TYPE\nNeodymium\n\nCONTROLS & CONNECTIVITY\n\nWIRED CONNECTIVITY\n3.5mm to 1/4in stereo adaptor\n\nMICROPHONE\nNo\n\nDESIGN & BUILD\n\nWEARING STYLE\nOver-Ear\n\nCABLE TYPE\n2.5m 1/4in to dual 4-pin mini-XLR cable, 2.5m 4-pin XLR to dual 4-pin, Mini-XLR cable\n\nWEIGHT\n543g\n\nIN THE BOX\n\nBOX CONTENTS\n1.

For more warranty details click here.\n\nHow is the overall sound of Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro?\n\nBeyerdynamic is a German brand that has made its mark as a fine headphone manufacturer and the DT 990 Pro model gives a neutral and clear sound.\n\nDoes Beyerdynamic - DT 990 Pro come with a mic?\n\nNo, the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro does not come with a mic since it is more of a studio monitoring headphone.\n\nIs Beyerdynamic - DT 990 Pro an over the ear or on the ear product?\n\nIt is a semi open over-the-ear headphone which gives a slightly increased sound isolation and reduced noise leakage\n\nHow is the overall fit?\n\nBeyerdynamic DT 990 Pro comes with an adjustable headband so that it firmly and comfortably cradles your head.\n\nDoes Beyerdynamic - DT 990 Pro have detachable cables?\n\nNo,it does not have detachable cable.\n\nWhich devices are compatible?\n\nThe DT 990 Pro is compatible with Android and iOS devices as well as studio monitoring eqiupments.\n\nIs Beyerdynamic - DT 990 Pro good for long useage?\n\nYes, due to it being durable, lightweight and soft earpads make music listening for long hours comfortable\n\nDoes it need an Amplifier?\n\nYes, since the driver units are bigger, they will need an amplifier so that the headphones can performance to its full potential.\n\nWhich hard case can I buy for my Beyerdynamic - DT 990 Pro?\n\nYou can get the Beyerdynamic - DT Hard Case for your DT 990 Pro.\n\nWhy isn't there a 600-ohms version of DT 990 Pro?\n\nSince most headphone output in professional environments isn't designed for 600-ohms headphones, Beyerdynamic only offers headphones with a maximum impedance of 250-ohms.\n\nWhat is the technical difference between DT 880/990 edition and DT 880/990 Pro?\n\nThe Pro series is designed for professional users and the Edition series are designed for end users. Also, the Pro and Edition series do not differ noticeably in terms of sound provided that they have the same impedance (e.g. the 250 ohms DT 880 Edition and the 250 ohms DT 880 Pro sound the same).\n\nHow does the Tygr 300 R differ from the DT 880 Pro and the DT 990 Pro?\n\nThe DT 880 PRO has a very linear frequency response, while the DT 990 PRO has a slightly more accentuated bass and accordingly more present trebles for a pleasant balance. Both are primarily designed for studio applications. The TYGR 300 R focuses on gaming. Powerful bass and detailed accentuated treble go very well with gaming. However, the sound design of the DT 990 PRO has been further optimized for gaming, sometimes through the use of a special acoustic fleece.\n\nHow can I tell what the impedance of my DT 770/880/990 Edition is?\n\nYou check the impedance of the integrated sound transducers from the connection plug. The impedance is sometimes hot-embossed onto the plastic shaft of the plug: If there is nothing there, the model has an impedance of 250 ohms. If it reads 32 Ω, the model has an impedance of 32 ohms. If it reads 600 Ω, the model has an impedance of 600 ohms.\n\nWhat do \"impedance\" and \"ohms\" mean?\n\nImpedance is the so-called alternating-current resistance that headphones have under specific standard conditions. On devices with low output impedance, headphones are the louder, the lower their impedance is. In principle, we recommend that you choose headphones with low impedance for use on devices that are operated by battery/rechargeable battery (i.e. most portable devices such as smartphones, tablet computers but also notebooks). You can distinguish between high and low impedance. Usually, the gradations 18 Ω, 32 Ω, and 80 Ω are used in the low range. In the high range, 250 Ω are common. If you want to get the most out of your system (and it has the power to do so), choose a model with 600 Ω like the T 1.\n\nAre the DT 990 Pro Available with less headband pressure?\n\nNo, the professional headphones are only available with the defined headband pressure. If the headband pressure is too strong for you, you can slightly try to expand the installed spring steel in the headband. For this purpose, we recommend stretching the headphones gradually for a few hours over books or similar. You should choose the width a little bit wider than the width of your head.\n\nBuying Guide\n\n10+ of the Best Over Ear Headphones in 2020\nby Abhijeeth Shetty May 09, 2020\nOver-ear headphones are one of the most popular types of headphones.
